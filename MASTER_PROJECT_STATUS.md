## 🎯 CRITICAL REMINDERS

### **NEVER:**
- Skip download workflow at session end
- Add features before completing core content
- Suggest waiting for perfection before launch
- Let chat close without downloading files
- Let token limits sneak up

### **ALWAYS:**
- Check status files at session start
- Provide download links at session end
- Focus on execution over planning
- Encourage shipping over perfecting
- Monitor token usage (warn at 150K, wrap at 170K)

### **KEEP IN MIND:**
- Jim is a marketing professional, not a pro developer
- Download workflow is SACRED
- Launch timeline is realistic: March 2026
- Quality bar is high: 7,000-9,000 words/lesson
- Projects provide context, NOT file storage
