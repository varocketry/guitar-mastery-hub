## ✨ Why This Fingering?

### **Advantages:**
1. **Easier for beginners** - No index finger stretch required
2. **Fuller bass sound** - Includes low E string (lowest G note)
3. **Clear finger spacing** - Fingers don't crowd together
4. **Good for strumming** - All 6 strings ring out

### **Compared to Standard G:**
- Standard G uses index, middle, ring (or middle, ring, pinky)
- This alternative uses middle, ring, pinky
- Leaves index finger free (useful for quick chord changes)
