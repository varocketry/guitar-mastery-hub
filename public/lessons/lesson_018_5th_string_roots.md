# Lesson 18: 5th String Roots & Advanced Transitions

---

## 🎯 THE MULTIPLICATION: Doubling Your Power with the Same Effort

**You're about to experience the most efficient lesson in guitar.**

**What you learned in Lesson 17:** Power chords on the 6th string (E string root)

**What you'll learn today:** The EXACT SAME TECHNIQUE on the 5th string (A string root)

**Time investment to learn 6th string power chords:** 4-6 days of practice

**Time investment to learn 5th string power chords:** 2-3 days (because you already know the pattern!)

**Here's why this is revolutionary:**

**Most guitar techniques require learning something NEW:**
- Barre chords = new finger shape, new pressure requirements, new challenges
- Fingerstyle = entirely new right-hand technique
- Lead guitar = scales, positions, picking patterns

**But 5th string root power chords?**

**You already know 95% of what you need.**

Same shape. Same fingers. Same palm muting. Same transitions.

**The ONLY difference:** Which string is the root.

**This is like learning Spanish after you learned French** - the grammar is already there, you're just learning new vocabulary.

**The Professional Secret:**

**Amateur power chord players:** Learn 6th string roots, stay there forever

They play:
- E5 on 6th string (fret 0)
- A5 on 6th string (fret 5)
- C5 on 6th string (fret 8)

**All their movement is UP and DOWN the neck.**

**Professional power chord players:** Mix 6th and 5th string roots constantly

They play:
- E5 on 6th string (fret 0)
- A5 on 5th string (fret 0) - right next to E5!
- C5 on 5th string (fret 3)

**Their movement is ACROSS the strings, not just up/down the neck.**

**Result:**
- Shorter position jumps (5 frets down to open? No - just move one string over!)
- Smoother bass lines (can play adjacent notes)
- More efficient fingering (less hand travel = more speed)
- Professional-sounding progressions (like the pros)

**This is the difference between:**
- Jumping from open position to 12th fret (amateur)
- Sliding smoothly from 6th to 5th string, staying in same zone (professional)

**The Famous Examples:**

**"Wild Thing" (The Troggs):**
```
Amateur version (all 6th string):
E5 (0) → A5 (5) → B5 (7) - lots of jumping

Professional version (mixed roots):
E5 (6th, 0) → A5 (5th, 0) → B5 (5th, 2) - smooth!
```

**"Louie Louie" (The Kingsmen):**
```
Uses 5th string roots for the entire progression
A5 → D5 → Em → D5
All on 5th string (or mixed) - incredibly efficient
```

**"All the Small Things" (Blink-182):**
```
C5 → G5 → F5
All on 5th string roots
Punk rock speed is possible BECAUSE of efficient fingering
```

**AC/DC's entire catalog:**

Malcolm Young plays **maybe 70% of his power chords on 5th string roots.**

Why? **Efficiency.**

He can stay in the same 5-fret zone and access more chords by moving across strings instead of up the neck.

**This is professional-level technique.**

**The Bass Line Secret:**

Ever wonder how rock guitarists create those incredible walking bass lines?

**They're using 5th string roots.**

Example progression:
```
6th string: E5 (0) → ...
5th string: E5 (7) → F5 (8) → F#5 (9) → G5 (10)
```

See how they can play adjacent notes? **That's the chromatic movement on 5th string.**

**You can't do this efficiently staying on 6th string alone.**

**The Speed Advantage:**

**Question:** How do punk guitarists play so fast?

**Answer:** Minimal hand movement.

By mixing 6th and 5th string roots, they can play entire progressions in a 3-fret zone:

```
Green Day "When I Come Around":
G5 (6th, 3) → D5 (5th, 5) → Em (5th, 7) → C5 (5th, 3)

All within 5 frets!
```

If you tried this all on 6th string:
```
G5 (3) → D5 (10) → Em (12) → C5 (8)

That's jumping 7 frets up, then 2 more, then back 4!
```

**Mixing roots = speed. Staying on one string = slow.**

**The Mental Breakthrough:**

Here's what changes today:

**Before today:**
- Power chord = specific fret on 6th string
- "A5 is at the 5th fret" (always thinking 6th string)

**After today:**
- Power chord = root note anywhere on bottom two strings
- "A5 is either 6th string fret 5 OR 5th string open"
- You choose based on context (what's most efficient)

**This is thinking like a professional.**

**The 10-Minute Rule:**

**If you truly mastered Lesson 17** (6th string roots), then **5th string roots will click in about 10 minutes.**

Seriously.

The shape is identical. Your fingers already know what to do.

**The only training needed:** Your brain learning to think "5th string can be root too."

**Then the rest of the lesson is about MIXING them** - making musical decisions about which root to use when.

**That's the advanced part.** Not the physical technique (you have that). The THINKING.

**The Fretboard Revelation:**

Look at your guitar neck right now.

**The 6th and 5th strings are parallel universes with identical laws.**

Every power chord that exists on the 6th string **also exists on the 5th string, just 5 frets higher.**

Example:
- E5 on 6th string = fret 0
- E5 on 5th string = fret 7

**Same chord. Different location. Same shape.**

Once you internalize this, the fretboard opens up:

**"I need an A5 chord..."**

**Brain options:**
- 6th string, fret 5? (sure, that works)
- 5th string, open? (also works!)

**Context decides:** Where's my hand right now? Which is closer? What comes next in the progression?

**This is professional decision-making.**

**The Stamina Benefit:**

Here's something nobody tells you:

**Mixing 6th and 5th string roots reduces hand fatigue.**

Why? **Different string tension.**

6th string (thickest) = requires most pressure
5th string (second thickest) = slightly easier

By alternating, you're **distributing the workload across different muscle groups.**

**Bassists do this instinctively** - they don't play everything on one string because it would exhaust that hand position.

**Same principle applies to power chords.**

**The Tonal Variety:**

**6th string root power chords:** Deep, heavy, aggressive
**5th string root power chords:** Brighter, punchier, defined

**Both sound like power chords, but the tonal quality is different.**

Professional producers and guitarists choose based on the song section:

**Verses:** Often 6th string (darker, more brooding)
**Choruses:** Often 5th string (brighter, more energy)
**Breakdowns:** 6th string all the way (maximum heaviness)

**You're not just learning a technique - you're learning an arranging tool.**

**The Efficiency Example:**

Let's say you need to play: **E5 → A5 → D5 → A5**

**Amateur approach (all 6th string):**
```
E5 (0) → A5 (5) → D5 (10) → A5 (5)
     +5 frets  +5 frets   -5 frets

Total hand travel: 15 frets
```

**Professional approach (mixed roots):**
```
E5 (6th, 0) → A5 (5th, 0) → D5 (5th, 5) → A5 (5th, 0)
         same position!  +5 frets    -5 frets

Total hand travel: 10 frets (33% less!)
```

**Less movement = more speed, less fatigue, fewer mistakes.**

**The Chromatic Power:**

With 5th string roots mastered, you can now play **chromatic movement** (half-step intervals):

```
A5 (5th, 0) → Bb5 (5th, 1) → B5 (5th, 2) → C5 (5th, 3)
          +1 fret      +1 fret      +1 fret
```

**This creates iconic bass lines:**
- "Another One Bites the Dust" style grooves
- Metal riffs with chromatic walks
- Punk rock energy

**You can't do this efficiently on 6th string** (well, you can, but it requires huge position jumps or awkward fingering).

**5th string = chromatic freedom.**

**The Practice Revelation:**

**Lesson 17 took 4-6 days of practice.**

Why? You were building:
- Finger strength for the shape
- Palm muting technique
- Transition fluidity
- Stamina

**Lesson 18 will take 2-3 days.**

Why so much faster?

**Because you already built all of that!**

Today is just:
- 10 minutes: "Oh, same shape on 5th string, got it"
- Rest of practice: Training your brain to CHOOSE efficiently (6th vs 5th)
- Building the mixed-root transitions

**The physical work is done. This is mental training.**

**The Promise:**

**By the end of today:**
- You'll form 5th string roots as easily as 6th string roots
- You'll understand when to choose which root
- You'll play simple mixed-root progressions smoothly
- Your power chord vocabulary will be DOUBLED

**By the end of this week:**
- Mixed roots will feel natural
- You'll make strategic fingering choices automatically
- Your playing will sound more professional (smoother, more efficient)
- Songs that seemed impossible will suddenly be easy

**Investment:** 2-3 days
**Return:** Double your power chord vocabulary forever

**This is the most efficient lesson in guitar.**

**The Confidence Shift:**

Something happens when you master both roots:

**Before:** "I can play power chords (kind of)"

**After:** "I OWN power chords. 6th string, 5th string, mixed, doesn't matter - I've got this."

This confidence translates to:
- More aggressive playing
- Faster learning of new songs
- Ability to figure out progressions by ear
- Creative freedom to write your own riffs

**This lesson doesn't just add a technique - it multiplies your confidence.**

**Ready to double your power chord vocabulary in 2-3 days?**

**Let's multiply.** 🎸

## 🎯 FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES

### The "Same Pattern, Different String" Principle

**The revolutionary insight:**

Power chords are a PATTERN, not a position.

**The pattern:**
- Root note on bottom string
- Same note (octave) on next string up, same fret
- Fifth interval on third string up, 2 frets higher

**This pattern works on:**
- 6th-5th-4th strings (what you learned in Lesson 17)
- 5th-4th-3rd strings (what you're learning today)
- 4th-3rd-2nd strings (advanced, rarely used)

**Same pattern. Different strings. That's it.**

### The "Efficiency First" Principle for Root Selection

**How to choose 6th vs 5th string root:**

**Use 6th string root when:**
- You want deeper, heavier tone
- Next chord is also on 6th string
- You're already in that hand position
- Metal/heavy sections need maximum low-end

**Use 5th string root when:**
- You want brighter, punchier tone
- Previous or next chord is on 5th string
- It reduces hand travel
- Chromatic movement is needed

**The decision takes 0.2 seconds once trained.**

Right now, you'll think consciously. After 100+ reps, it becomes automatic - your hand just "knows" the efficient choice.

**This is professional-level thinking.**

## 📖 THEORY: 5th String Root Power Chords

### The Pattern Transfers!

**Key insight**: Power chords work identically on ALL adjacent string pairs!

**6th String Root** (what you learned in Lesson 17):
```
Root on E string (6th)
     ↓
E|----X----
A|----X---- ← Root octave (same fret)
D|----X---- ← Fifth (2 frets higher)
```

**5th String Root** (what you'll learn today):
```
Root on A string (5th)
     ↓
A|----X----
D|----X---- ← Root octave (same fret)
G|----X---- ← Fifth (2 frets higher)

SAME SHAPE, DIFFERENT STRINGS!
```

### Visual Comparison

**E5 on 6th string (open position):**
```
e|---
B|---
G|---
D|--2← Ring finger (fifth: B note)
A|--2← Middle finger (root octave: E note)
E|--0← Open string (root: E note)
```

**A5 on 5th string (open position):**
```
e|---
B|---
G|--2← Ring finger (fifth: E note)
D|--2← Middle finger (root octave: A note)
A|--0← Open string (root: A note)
E|--X← MUTED (don't play!)
```

**See it?** Identical finger shape. One string higher. That's the ONLY difference.

### Why Learn Both?

**Practical reasons**:
- ✅ Access to different chord voicings (tonal variety)
- ✅ Smooth bass line movement (chromatic walks)
- ✅ More efficient fretboard navigation (less jumping)
- ✅ Essential for complex progressions (professional technique)
- ✅ Reduced hand travel = increased speed

**Musical example**:

Instead of jumping from 3rd fret to 15th fret (same chord, different octave), you can move from 6th string 3rd fret to 5th string 5th fret (right nearby!).

**Same chord, 80% less hand movement.**

### The Theory Behind Root Choice

**When to use 6th string roots**:
- Lower, heavier sound (metal, hard rock)
- Bass-heavy progressions
- Maximum low-end presence
- Open E5 for deepest possible chord

**When to use 5th string roots**:
- Brighter, punchier tone (punk, pop-punk)
- Easier melodic movement (chromatic walking)
- Mixed with 6th string for bass lines
- Reduced hand travel in progressions

**Pro tip**: Great players mix both constantly! The best choice depends on CONTEXT, not absolute rules.

## 🎸 TECHNIQUE #1: 5th String Root Power Chords

### The Basic 5th String Shape

**A5 (Open Position)**:
```
e|---     Muted (don't play)
B|---     Muted (don't play)
G|--2←    Fifth (E note) - Ring finger OR Pinky
D|--2←    Root octave (A note) - Middle finger
A|--0←    Root (A note) - Open string
E|--X←    CRITICAL: Must be muted!
```

**Finger placement:**
- Open A string (no finger)
- Middle finger on D string, 2nd fret
- Ring finger (or pinky) on G string, 2nd fret
- LOW E STRING MUST BE MUTED!

---

### CRITICAL: Muting the 6th String

**Why it matters:**

If you accidentally play the 6th string (low E) when playing A5, it adds a wrong note (E) to an A chord.

**Result:** Muddy, dissonant sound. Immediately recognizable as sloppy technique.

**How to mute the 6th string:**

**Method 1: Left thumb wrap (primary method)**
```
- Wrap thumb slightly over top of neck
- Tip of thumb lightly touches low E string
- Just enough contact to deaden it (no pitch)
- Thumb should be relaxed, not gripping
```

**Test:** Strum all 6 strings. Low E should make a "thunk" (no pitch).

**Method 2: Index finger light touch**
```
- Let index finger extend slightly toward 6th string
- Fingertip lightly touches it (doesn't press)
- Only works when you're playing higher frets
- Not reliable for open position
```

**Method 3: Strategic strumming (backup)**
```
- Start your strum ON the A string (not above it)
- Visual focus: watch where pick hits
- This is backup, not primary method
- Muting is more reliable than hoping you strum perfectly
```

**Practice the muting:**

1. Form A5 (open position)
2. Strum ALL 6 strings deliberately
3. Low E should be SILENT (or dead "thunk")
4. If you hear E note, adjust thumb muting
5. Repeat until muting is automatic

**This takes 5 minutes to learn, saves hours of sloppy-sounding playing.**

---

### Step-by-Step: Forming Perfect A5

**Step 1: Hand Position (30 seconds)**
1. Place left hand in "ready" position
2. Thumb behind neck, slightly wrapped over top
3. Thumb TIP touches low E string lightly
4. Fingers hovering above A, D, G strings

**Step 2: Finger Placement (1 minute)**
1. Middle finger on D string, 2nd fret
2. Ring finger on G string, 2nd fret
3. Both fingers **on tips** (nearly vertical)
4. **Right behind fret wires** for best tone
5. Open A string rings clearly

**Step 3: Sound Check (30 seconds)**
1. Strum from A string down (3 strings: A, D, G)
2. Listen: A (low) - A (octave) - E (fifth)
3. Check low E is muted (strum all 6 to test)
4. All three notes should ring clearly

**Step 4: Comparison with E5**

Play both back-to-back:
```
E5 (6th string root) → A5 (5th string root)
```

**Notice:**
- Identical hand shape
- One string higher
- A5 sounds brighter than E5
- Same power chord quality

**If they sound equally strong and clear, you've got it!**

---

**Practice Exercise 1: A5 Mastery Drill (10 minutes)**

**Tempo: 40 BPM**

**Phase 1: Form and Release (3 minutes)**
```
Form A5 → Strum → Hold 4 beats → Release → Rest → Repeat

Count: 1, 2, 3, 4 (hold chord)
       1, 2, 3, 4 (rest, fingers off)
```

Do this 15 times.

**Goal:** Thumb automatically mutes low E. Every formation is identical.

**Phase 2: Low E Muting Test (3 minutes)**

Form A5, then:
1. Strum all 6 strings deliberately
2. Low E should be SILENT
3. If it rings, adjust thumb
4. Repeat until automatic

Do 20 repetitions (strum all 6 strings each time).

**Phase 3: Continuous Quarter Notes (4 minutes)**
```
A5  A5  A5  A5  | A5  A5  A5  A5  |
 ↓   ↓   ↓   ↓  |  ↓   ↓   ↓   ↓  |
 1   2   3   4  |  1   2   3   4  |
```

Play A5 on every beat. Downstrokes only. Strum from A string.

**Do 10 measures** (40 strums total).

**Goal:** Consistent tone. Low E never rings. Every strum sounds identical.

---

### Moving 5th String Power Chords

**C5 (3rd fret, 5th string root)**:
```
e|---
B|---
G|--5← Ring finger OR Pinky
D|--5← Middle finger
A|--3← Index finger (root!)
E|--X← Muted
```

**D5 (5th fret, 5th string root)**:
```
e|---
B|---
G|--7← Ring finger OR Pinky
D|--7← Middle finger
A|--5← Index finger (root!)
E|--X← Muted
```

**The movable pattern:**
- Index finger: Root (5th string)
- Middle finger: Root octave (4th string, same fret as index)
- Ring finger (or pinky): Fifth (3rd string, 2 frets higher)

**This is identical to 6th string pattern, just moved to 5th string!**

---

**Practice Exercise 2: 5th String Movement Drill (15 minutes)**

**Tempo: 40 BPM**

**Phase 1: A5-C5-D5 Formation (5 minutes)**

Each chord gets 4 beats:
```
A5 (open) | C5 (3rd) | D5 (5th) | A5 (open) |
```

**Do 10 complete cycles.**

**Focus:** Clean transitions. Thumb always mutes low E. Consistent tone on all three.

**Phase 2: Chromatic Movement (5 minutes)**

Half-step intervals (1 fret at a time):
```
A5 (0) → Bb5 (1) → B5 (2) → C5 (3) → C#5 (4) → D5 (5)
      +1      +1      +1       +1        +1
```

Play each chord 4 times (4 beats), then move up.

**Repeat the chromatic climb 5 times.**

**This is the famous "chromatic walk" bassline pattern!**

**Phase 3: Speed Building (5 minutes)**

Same A5-C5-D5 progression, but **each chord gets only 2 beats:**
```
A5    | C5    | D5    | A5    |
1, 2  | 1, 2  | 1, 2  | 1, 2  |
```

**Do 10 cycles at 50 BPM** (slightly faster than previous exercises).

**Goal:** Maintain quality while increasing speed.

## 🎸 TECHNIQUE #2: Mixing 6th and 5th String Roots

### The Strategic Decision

**This is where professionals separate from amateurs.**

**Amateur thinking:** "I learned 6th string, I'll just use that"

**Professional thinking:** "Which root gets me there most efficiently?"

### Example Progression Analysis

**Progression: E5 → A5 → D5 → A5**

**Option 1: All 6th string roots (amateur)**
```
E5 (6th, 0) → A5 (6th, 5) → D5 (6th, 10) → A5 (6th, 5)
          +5 frets      +5 frets       -5 frets

Total hand travel: 15 frets
Difficulty: HIGH (long jumps)
Speed: SLOW (takes time to jump positions)
```

**Option 2: Mixed roots (professional)**
```
E5 (6th, 0) → A5 (5th, 0) → D5 (5th, 5) → A5 (5th, 0)
          same fret!     +5 frets      -5 frets

Total hand travel: 10 frets
Difficulty: LOW (short movements)
Speed: FAST (efficient fingering)
```

**See the difference?**

By switching to 5th string for A5, you stay at open position! Then all subsequent chords are on 5th string with minimal movement.

**This is professional-level efficiency.**

---

**Practice Exercise 3: Mixed Root Transitions (20 minutes)**

**Tempo: 40 BPM**

**Phase 1: Basic Mix (E5 to A5 on different strings) - 7 minutes**

```
E5 (6th, 0) → A5 (5th, 0) → E5 (6th, 0) → A5 (5th, 0)
```

**Each chord gets 4 beats.**

**The challenge:** Your hand shifts from 6th string shape to 5th string shape.

**Key technique:**
- E5: Fingers on 6th-5th-4th strings
- Shift hand position slightly higher for A5
- A5: Fingers on 5th-4th-3rd strings
- Remember to mute low E for A5!

**Do this 20 times until smooth.**

**Phase 2: Classic Rock Pattern (7 minutes)**

The I-IV-V in E:
```
E5 (6th, 0) → A5 (5th, 0) → B5 (5th, 2) → A5 (5th, 0) → E5 (6th, 0)
```

**This is "Wild Thing", "Louie Louie", thousands of rock songs!**

Each chord gets 4 beats.

**Do 15 complete cycles.**

**Phase 3: "Back to Black" Style (6 minutes)**

Mix both roots in one progression:
```
E5 (6th, 0) → D5 (5th, 5) → A5 (5th, 0) → E5 (6th, 0)
```

**Notice:** Starts on 6th string, switches to 5th for D and A, returns to 6th for E.

**This creates a professional bass line movement.**

Each chord gets 4 beats.

**Do 12 complete cycles.**

---

## 🎸 TECHNIQUE #3: Eighth-Note Rhythms with Mixed Roots

### Building Speed and Fluency

**So far:** Quarter notes (one strum per beat) at 40-50 BPM

**Next level:** Eighth notes (two strums per beat) with mixed roots

**Eighth note pattern:**
```
| /  ÊŒ  /  ÊŒ  /  ÊŒ  /  ÊŒ |
  1  &  2  &  3  &  4  &
  ↓  ↑  ↓  ↑  ↓  ↑  ↓  ↑
  Down Up Down Up Down Up Down Up
```

**This is punk rock speed.**

---

**Practice Exercise 4: Eighth-Note Mixed Roots (20 minutes)**

**Tempo: 60 BPM** (eighth notes at this tempo = comfortable speed)

**Phase 1: Single Chord Eighth Notes (5 minutes)**

A5 (5th string, open):
```
A5: ↓ ↑ ↓ ↑ ↓ ↑ ↓ ↑ |
    1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &
```

**Play this pattern for 2 minutes straight.**

**All downstrokes first:**
```
A5: ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ |
    1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &
```

**Then alternate (down-up-down-up):**
```
A5: ↓ ↑ ↓ ↑ ↓ ↑ ↓ ↑ |
```

**Goal:** Consistent tone. No difference between downstrokes and upstrokes.

**Phase 2: Two-Chord Eighth Notes (7 minutes)**

E5-A5 progression:
```
E5 (6th) | E5 (6th) | A5 (5th) | A5 (5th) |
↓ ↑ ↓ ↑ | ↓ ↑ ↓ ↑ | ↓ ↑ ↓ ↑ | ↓ ↑ ↓ ↑ |
```

**Each chord gets 2 measures (8 eighth notes).**

**Do 10 complete cycles.**

**Phase 3: Punk Progression (8 minutes)**

Fast punk rock pattern:
```
E5 | A5 | D5 | A5 |
```

**Each chord gets 1 measure** (8 eighth notes).

All on 6th string OR strategic mix:
- E5 on 6th (0)
- A5 on 5th (0) - efficient!
- D5 on 5th (5)
- A5 on 5th (0)

**Tempo: 80 BPM** (challenge yourself!)

**Do until comfortable** (probably 5-10 minutes of practice).

---

## 🎵 MUSICAL APPLICATION: Famous Songs

### Song 1: "Wild Thing" (The Troggs)

**The progression:**
```
E5 (6th, 0) | A5 (5th, 0) | B5 (5th, 2) | A5 (5th, 0) |
```

**Rhythm:** Quarter notes (4 strums per chord)

**Why this works:**
- Only uses 3 chords
- Minimal hand movement (E is 6th string, rest on 5th)
- Classic three-chord rock
- Perfect for practicing mixed roots

**Tempo:** Start at 80 BPM, work toward 118 BPM (original tempo)

**Practice:** Play the 4-chord loop 20 times straight.

---

### Song 2: "Louie Louie" (The Kingsmen)

**The progression:**
```
A5 (5th, 0) | D5 (5th, 5) | Em (5th, 7) | D5 (5th, 5) |
```

**All on 5th string!** Maximum efficiency.

**Rhythm:** Eighth notes (the classic "duh duh-duh, duh duh" pattern)

**Why this is legendary:**
- Entire song uses 3 chords
- All on 5th string = never leaves 7-fret zone
- This is WHY it's so easy to play fast
- Professional fingering from the start

**Tempo:** Original is around 123 BPM. Start at 80 BPM.

---

### Song 3: "All the Small Things" (Blink-182)

**The progression (verse):**
```
C5 (5th, 3) | G5 (6th, 3) | F5 (6th, 1) | C5 (5th, 3) |
```

**Notice the mix:** C on 5th, G on 6th, F on 6th, back to C on 5th.

**Why this fingering:**
- C5 on 5th (3rd fret) is brighter for the verse
- G5 and F5 on 6th are nearby (3rd and 1st fret)

### ⏰ NOT READY YET?

**That's completely fine!** This lesson typically takes 2-4 days.

**If 5th string roots feel awkward:**
- Remember: you already know the shape!
- Focus on thumb muting (that's the only new skill)
- Practice open A5 for 10 minutes straight (build muscle memory)
- Compare side-by-side with 6th string E5 (same shape, different location)

**If low E keeps ringing:**
- This is THE most common issue
- Check thumb position (should wrap slightly over)
- Thumb should LIGHTLY touch low E (not press)
- Practice strumming all 6 strings deliberately to test muting
- Mark your thumb position with a small dot (visual reminder)

**If mixed transitions are confusing:**
- Practice JUST E5→A5 for 10 minutes (ignore everything else)
- Then JUST A5→E5 for 10 minutes
- The brain needs repetition to internalize the switch
- After 100+ reps, it becomes automatic

**If speed is lagging:**
- You're probably trying to rush
- Stay at 40 BPM until every transition is PERFECT
- Then 50 BPM
- Speed comes automatically from precision
- Don't force it

## 💭 MOTIVATIONAL NOTE

### You Just Doubled Your Vocabulary

**Congratulations on the most efficient lesson in guitar!**

**Lesson 17:** 4-6 days to learn 6th string roots
**Lesson 18:** 2-4 days to learn 5th string roots

**Same result (mastery), half the time.**

**Why?** Because you're learning PATTERNS, not isolated skills.

**This is smart practice.**

Every future technique you learn will build on previous foundations. The learning curve gets FASTER over time, not slower.

**You're proof of that today.**

**The professional mindset you built:**

You now think: "Which root is most efficient for THIS progression?"

Not: "I learned it one way, so I'll always do it that way."

**That's professional-level thinking.**

**Keep at it. The multiplication continues.** 🎸✓ï¸
