# Lesson 19: Power Chord Riffs & Three-Note Voicings

## 🎸 THE SIGNATURE: BUILDING YOUR ICONIC SOUND

**Every guitarist you've ever loved is remembered for their RIFFS.**

Not their scales. Not their theory knowledge. Not their technical exercises.

**Their RIFFS.**

- Jimmy Page = "Whole Lotta Love"
- Tony Iommi = "Iron Man"
- Kurt Cobain = "Smells Like Teen Spirit"
- Jack White = "Seven Nation Army"
- Keith Richards = "Satisfaction"

**These aren't just songs. These are IDENTITY.**

When you hear those opening notes, you don't think "that's a power chord progression." You think "that's BLACK SABBATH" or "that's NIRVANA."

**This is what you're learning today: How to create your signature.**

---

### The Game-Changing Realization

**Here's what separates guitarists who are forgotten from guitarists who are remembered:**

❌ **The Forgotten Guitarist:**
- Learns scales perfectly
- Plays fast and clean
- Masters every technique in books
- Can play other people's songs flawlessly
- **But creates nothing original**

✅ **The Remembered Guitarist:**
- Knows enough technique to express ideas
- Focuses on simplicity and memorability
- Creates ONE iconic riff
- Makes it THEIR sound
- **People remember them forever**

**Tony Iommi never learned jazz chords or advanced theory.** He learned power chords and **CREATED** "Iron Man," "Paranoid," and "War Pigs."

**Kurt Cobain couldn't play classically trained guitar.** He knew power chords and **CREATED** "Teen Spirit," "Come as You Are," and "Heart-Shaped Box."

**Jack White deliberately limits himself to simple techniques.** And he **CREATED** one of the most recognizable riffs of the 2000s with just two notes.

**You already have the technical skills. Today you learn to WEAPONIZE them.**

---

### What Makes a Riff Iconic?

**It's not complexity. It's MEMORABILITY.**

**Listen to "Seven Nation Army":**
- Seven notes
- One power chord shape
- Played slowly
- **Everyone on Earth knows it**

**Listen to "Smoke on the Water":**
- Three power chord shapes
- Simple rhythm
- No fancy techniques
- **Literally the most famous riff in rock history**

**The formula is simpler than you think:**

**SIMPLE CORE IDEA + REPETITION + ATTITUDE = ICONIC**

- Simple: 3-6 notes maximum
- Repetition: Same idea, over and over
- Attitude: **How** you play matters more than **what** you play

**Two guitarists can play the exact same notes, and one will sound forgettable while the other sounds iconic.** The difference is attitude, conviction, and commitment to the sound.

---

### The Professional Secret: Three-Note Voicings

**You've been playing two-note power chords** (Lessons 17-18):
```
E5 (two notes):
A|--2--
E|--0--

Sound: Tight, focused, precise
```

**Today you add the octave** (three notes):
```
E5 (three notes):
D|--2-- ← Added octave
A|--2--
E|--0--

Sound: FULL, rich, professional
```

**That one extra note transforms everything.**

**Why professionals use three-note voicings:**
- ✅ Fuller sound (more sonic weight)
- ✅ More presence in a mix (cuts through drums and bass)
- ✅ Richer tone (sounds expensive and produced)
- ✅ Classic rock sound (this IS the rock guitar tone)

**Listen to any AC/DC song.** Malcolm Young uses three-note power chords almost exclusively. **That's why they sound so MASSIVE** despite being "simple."

**Listen to Metallica's rhythm parts.** James Hetfield's palm-muted three-note chords create the heaviest sound in metal. **That fullness = three notes, not two.**

**This is the professional upgrade.**

---

### Your Identity Shift Today

**Before today:**
"I know power chords."

**After today:**
"I create riffs."

**That's not a technique upgrade. That's an IDENTITY upgrade.**

You're not just learning to play guitar anymore. You're learning to **CREATE MUSIC.**

**The riff you create today might be:**
- The intro to your band's first song
- The hook for your YouTube channel
- The signature sound that defines your style
- The riff that makes your friends say "whoa, you wrote THAT?"

**Professional musicians don't just learn technique. They CREATE IDENTITY.**

**Today, you become a creator.**

---

### What Tony Iommi Learned (That Changed Rock Forever)

**Tony Iommi lost the tips of two fingers in a factory accident** when he was 17.

Everyone told him: "You can't play guitar anymore."

**He disagreed.**

He couldn't play complex jazz chords. He couldn't play fast lead lines. Traditional technique was impossible.

**So he invented HEAVY METAL with power chords.**

"Iron Man." "War Pigs." "Paranoid." "Sweet Leaf."

**Every single one: Power chord riffs.**

**He turned limitation into innovation.** He turned simplicity into POWER.

**His quote:** *"I never learned other people's riffs. I just learned power chords and made up my own. That became Black Sabbath's sound."*

**You have BETTER technique than Tony Iommi had.** Think about that.

You have ten working fingers. You've mastered both two-note and three-note shapes. You've practiced palm muting and rhythm control.

**You have everything you need to create iconic riffs.**

**The only question: Will you?**

---

### The Simplicity Principle (Jack White's Philosophy)

**Jack White** (The White Stripes, The Raconteurs):

*"The best riffs are the ones a 10-year-old could play. Simple, memorable, powerful. If you need technical mastery to play it, you've already lost."*

**"Seven Nation Army" riff:**
- One power chord shape
- Moves up and down the fretboard
- Seven notes total
- **EVERYONE knows it**

**Could you write something that simple?** YES.

**Would it be as iconic?** Maybe not. But that's not the point.

**The point: START CREATING.**

Write 100 riffs. 99 might be forgettable. One might be YOUR "Seven Nation Army."

**You won't know which until you create them all.**

---

---

### Kurt Cobain's Philosophy

*"I'm not a great guitar player. But I know how to write a riff that gets stuck in your head. That's all that matters."*

**Cobain couldn't play Clapton solos. He couldn't play jazz chords. He had limited technical ability.**

**But he wrote:**
- "Teen Spirit" (one of the most iconic riffs ever)
- "Come as You Are" (instantly recognizable)
- "Heart-Shaped Box" (haunting and memorable)

**All power chord riffs.**

**You have the same tools he had. The same chords. The same technique.**

**What will YOU create?**

## 🔥 FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLE: "Slow is Smooth, Smooth is Fast"

### The Malcolm Young Practice Method

**Malcolm Young** (AC/DC rhythm guitarist):

*"I practice every riff at 40 BPM with a metronome. When it's perfect at 40, I go to 45. When it's perfect at 45, I go to 50. I never skip steps."*

**This is why AC/DC's riffs sound MASSIVE:**
- Absolutely precise timing
- Every note perfectly placed
- Zero sloppiness
- **Built from slow, perfect practice**

### Today's Tempo Guidelines

**For three-note power chords:**
- Start: 40 BPM (learning the shape)
- Target: 60-80 BPM (musical tempo)
- Professional: 100+ BPM (rock song speed)

**For riff creation:**
- Start: 50 BPM (getting the notes right)
- Target: 80-100 BPM (musical feel)
- Professional: 120+ BPM (full energy)

**For iconic riff learning:**
- Start: 30-40 BPM (half speed or slower)
- Target: Original song tempo
- Professional: Faster than original (for mastery)

### The Metronome Contract

**Every practice session:**
1. Start at comfortable tempo
2. Play perfectly 10 times in a row
3. Increase by 5 BPM
4. Repeat process
5. **Never rush**

**Malcolm Young practiced this way for 50 years.** That's why he's a legend.

**You can do it for 5-7 days.** That's all it takes to master Lesson 19.

## 📖 THEORY: Three-Note Power Chords

### Beyond the Two-Note Shape

**So far you've learned**: Root + Fifth (two notes)

**Today you'll add**: The octave (three notes)

**Why add the octave?**
- ✅ Fuller, richer sound
- ✅ More presence in mix
- ✅ Better for rhythm parts
- ✅ Professional voicing
- ✅ Classic rock sound

### The Three-Note Shape

**E5 Three-Note Voicing**:
```
e|---
B|---
G|---
D|--2← Fifth (B note)
A|--2← Root (E note)
E|--0← Root octave (E note - lower)
     ↑
  All three notes are part of E5!
```

**What changed?** Added the octave root on 4th string (D string)

### Interval Analysis

**The three notes**:
1. **Root** (E on 6th string)
2. **Fifth** (B on 5th string - 7 semitones above root)
3. **Octave** (E on 4th string - 12 semitones above root)

**Why this sounds good**:
- Octaves reinforce the root (same note, higher pitch)
- Perfect fifths are consonant (stable, pleasing)
- No dissonance (no clashing notes)

### Two-Note vs. Three-Note Comparison

**Two-Note (Basic)**:
```
E5 (two notes):
D|--2--
A|--2--
E|--0--

Sound: Strong, focused, tight
Best for: Fast passages, metal, precise rhythm
```

**Three-Note (Full)**:
```
E5 (three notes):
D|--2--
A|--2--
E|--0--
G|--0-- ← Added octave

Sound: Full, rich, powerful
Best for: Rhythm parts, classic rock, fuller arrangements
```

**Both are correct!** Use situationally.

## 🎸 TECHNIQUE #1: Three-Note Power Chords

### The Finger Pattern

**Two approaches**:

**Method 1: Index-Ring-Pinky** (Recommended)
```
E5:
D|--2← Pinky
A|--2← Ring finger
E|--0← Open

F5:
D|--3← Pinky
A|--3← Ring finger
E|--1← Index finger (barre)
```

**Method 2: Index-Middle-Ring** (Alternative)
```
F5:
D|--3← Ring finger
A|--3← Middle finger
E|--1← Index finger (barre)
```

**Which to use?**
- Method 1 (with pinky) allows more speed
- Method 2 (without pinky) if you have weak pinky
- Try both, choose what feels natural

### Step-by-Step: Learning Three-Note Shapes

**Learning E5 (Three-Note)** (15 minutes)

**Step 1: Add the Octave** (5 min)
1. Form regular two-note E5 (strings 6 and 5)
2. Add pinky on D string, 2nd fret
3. Strum all three strings (E-A-D)
4. Listen to the fuller sound
5. Repeat 20 times

**Step 2: Comparison Exercise** (5 min)
```
Two-note E5: Strum 4 times
Three-note E5: Strum 4 times

Hear the difference?
Three-note has more "body" and presence
```

**Step 3: Clean Sound Check** (5 min)
- All three strings must ring clearly
- If buzzing: Check pinky angle and pressure
- If muted: Check fingers aren't touching adjacent strings
- Practice until consistent

### Moving to F5 (Three-Note Barre)

**F5 Three-Note**:
```
e|---
B|---
G|---
D|--3← Pinky
A|--3← Ring finger
E|--1← Index finger (barre)
```

**This is challenging!** Three fingers working together on different frets.

**Practice Approach** (20 minutes):

**Stage 1**: Index alone (5 min)
- Just barre the 1st fret on E string
- Get it clean and strong

**Stage 2**: Add ring finger (5 min)
- Index on 1st, ring on 3rd (A string)
- Two-note F5 solid

**Stage 3**: Add pinky (10 min)
- All three fingers
- Complete three-note F5
- This takes time - be patient!

### Common Three-Note Power Chords

**Essential shapes**:

| Chord | Fret Position | Strings Played |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| E5 | 0-2-2 | E-A-D |
| F5 | 1-3-3 | E-A-D |
| G5 | 3-5-5 | E-A-D |
| A5 | 5-7-7 | E-A-D |
| A5 | 0-2-2 | A-D-G (5th string root) |
| D5 | 5-7-7 | A-D-G |

### Practice Routine: Three-Note Power Chords

**Exercise 1: Open Position Mastery** (15 minutes)
```
E5 (three-note) → A5 (three-note, 5th string root)

E5: E-A-D strings (0-2-2)
A5: A-D-G strings (0-2-2)

4 beats each
20 repetitions
Tempo: 60 BPM
```

**Exercise 2: Movable Shape Practice** (15 minutes)
```
F5 → G5 → A5 (all three-note, 6th string roots)
1-3-3  3-5-5  5-7-7

2 strums per chord
Focus on clean formation
Tempo: 50 BPM
```

**Exercise 3: Full vs. Basic Comparison** (10 minutes)
```
Play same progression both ways:

Version 1 (two-note): E5-A5-D5-A5
Version 2 (three-note): E5-A5-D5-A5

Which sounds better for what you're playing?
```

## 🎸 TECHNIQUE #2: Riff Construction Principles

### What Makes a Great Riff?

**A riff** = Short, repeated musical phrase that defines a song

**Characteristics of memorable riffs**:
- ✅ Repetitive (easy to remember)
- ✅ Rhythmically interesting (not just straight quarter notes)
- ✅ Melodically simple (usually 3-6 notes)
- ✅ Powerful (uses power chords or strong intervals)
- ✅ Catchy (gets stuck in your head)

**Examples**:
- "Smoke on the Water" - Deep Purple
- "Iron Man" - Black Sabbath
- "Seven Nation Army" - White Stripes
- "Smells Like Teen Spirit" - Nirvana

### Riff Construction Formula

**Basic riff building blocks**:

**1. Root Movement** (where the bass note goes)
```
Example: E → G → A
Creates tension and resolution
```

**2. Rhythm Pattern** (when you play the notes)
```
Example: Short-short-long
Eighth-eighth-quarter note
```

**3. Repetition** (how often it repeats)
```
Usually: 2, 4, or 8 measure phrases
Odd numbers (3, 5, 7) create tension
```

**4. Variation** (how it changes)
```
Play main riff 3 times
Play variation on 4th time
This is VERY common!
```

### The "Call and Response" Technique

**Pattern**: Statement → Answer → Statement → Answer

**Example**:
```
Measure 1-2: E5-G5-A5 (statement)
Measure 3-4: A5-G5-E5 (answer - reverses the statement)

This creates satisfying musical conversation!
```

### Creating Your First Riff

**Step-by-Step Riff Creation** (20 minutes):

**Step 1: Choose 3-4 Power Chords** (5 min)
- Pick chords that sound good together
- Example: E5, G5, A5, D5
- Play them in different orders
- Which order sounds best?

**Step 2: Add a Rhythm** (5 min)
```
Try these patterns with your chord choices:

Pattern A: / / / /     (all quarter notes)
Pattern B: / / . /     (quarter-quarter-rest-quarter)
Pattern C: / . / / .   (quarter-rest-quarter-quarter-rest)

Which creates most interest?
```

**Step 3: Create a Two-Measure Phrase** (5 min)
- Combine chords and rhythm
- Play it 10 times
- Adjust what doesn't sound good
- Simplify if too complex

**Step 4: Add Variation** (5 min)
- Play main phrase 3 times
- Change something on 4th time
- Maybe: different ending chord
- Or: different rhythm
- Or: add a pause

**Congratulations - you've written a riff!**

### Practice Routine: Riff Creation

**Exercise 1: Riff Deconstruction** (15 minutes)
```
Take "Smoke on the Water" opening:
G5-Bb5-C5  G5-Bb5-Db5-C5  G5-Bb5-C5-Bb5-G5

Analyze:
- How many different chords? (4: G5, Bb5, C5, Db5)
- What's the rhythm pattern? (Mostly eighth notes)
- How does it create interest? (Ascending then descending motion)
- What makes it memorable? (Simple, repetitive, powerful)

Play it slowly 20 times
```

**Exercise 2: Variation Workshop** (15 minutes)
```
Take simple riff: E5-G5-A5-G5 (repeat)

Create 3 variations:
1. Change rhythm (make one chord longer)
2. Change order (A5-G5-E5-G5)
3. Add pause (E5-G5-[pause]-A5)

Which variation sounds best?
```

**Exercise 3: Original Creation** (20 minutes)
```
Your assignment:
- Choose 3 power chords
- Create 4-measure riff
- Play it 30 times
- Record it
- Listen back critically
- Refine it

This is YOUR signature riff!
```

---

## 🎸 TECHNIQUE #3: String Dampening & Control

### Selective String Ringing

**Challenge**: When playing power chords, you only want CERTAIN strings to ring.

**Example with E5 three-note**:
```
You WANT these to ring:
D|--2--  ✅
A|--2--  ✅
E|--0--  ✅

You DON'T want these:
G|--x--  ❌ (mute this!)
B|--x--  ❌ (mute this!)
e|--x--  ❌ (mute this!)
```

### The "Choke" Technique

**What it is**: Lifting fingers slightly to stop strings from ringing

**When to use it**:
- Creating rhythmic effects
- Stopping ring between riff phrases
- Staccato (short, punchy) sounds

**How to do it**:
1. Play power chord fully (all notes ring)
2. Slightly release finger pressure (keep contact but don't press)
3. Strings stop ringing but fingers stay in position
4. Can quickly press again for next note

**Practice Exercise** (10 minutes):
```
E5 (play) - choke - E5 (play) - choke - E5 (play) - choke

Rhythm: Quarter note - eighth rest - quarter note - eighth rest

Creates: CHUNG-chuck-CHUNG-chuck-CHUNG-chuck sound
```

### Palm Muting with Three-Note Chords

**Technique**: Same as with two-note chords, but muting THREE strings now

**Position**:
- Side of palm rests on E, A, AND D strings
- Right at the bridge
- Light pressure

**Sound difference**:
- Unmuted three-note: **CHUNG** (open, ringing, loud)
- Palm-muted three-note: **chunk** (tight, controlled, aggressive)

**Practice Pattern** (15 minutes):
```
E5 (open) - E5 (muted) - E5 (open) - E5 (muted)
|    /    |    /      |    /    |    /      |

4 repetitions
Focus on consistent mute pressure
Tempo: 60 BPM
```

**What makes it great**:
- Heavy, slow tempo (doom metal founder)
- Simple power chord movement
- Massive sound (three-note voicings)
- Repetitive and hypnotic
- **ATTITUDE** - the way it's played matters

### The Riff Breakdown

**Main Riff** (simplified for learning):
```
B5    D5    E5    G5    F#5   G5    F#5   E5    D5
|  /  |  /  |  /  |  /  |  /  |  /  |  /  |  /  |  /  |

All three-note power chords
Slow tempo: 60-70 BPM
Heavy palm muting throughout
Play with CONVICTION
```

**Chord positions** (6th string roots):
- B5: 7-9-9
- D5: 10-12-12
- E5: 12-14-14
- G5: 15-17-17
- F#5: 14-16-16

### Step-by-Step Practice

**Stage 1: Learn Chord Positions** (15 minutes)
- Find each chord on fretboard
- Play each 10 times clean
- No rhythm yet, just positions

**Stage 2: Add Slow Rhythm** (15 minutes)
- Play progression at 40 BPM
- One strum per chord
- Focus on transitions

**Stage 3: Add Palm Muting** (15 minutes)
- Same progression, same tempo
- Add consistent palm mute
- Should sound tight and heavy

**Stage 4: Full Speed** (15 minutes)
- Gradually increase to 60-70 BPM
- Keep palm mute consistent
- Play with ATTITUDE

### The Tony Iommi Feel

**This riff isn't about technique - it's about ATTITUDE.**

Play it like:
- You're wearing leather
- You just discovered the heaviest sound on Earth
- You're about to invent heavy metal
- Each note is a STATEMENT

**That attitude = what makes it iconic.**

**"Seven Nation Army"** = Proof that simple = powerful

**The genius**:
- One power chord shape
- Moves up and down one string
- Seven notes total
- **Everyone on Earth knows it**

### The Riff (Original Version)

**Single notes** (NOT power chords):
```
E|--7--7--10--7--5--3--2--|
```

**But we can play it with power chords** (fuller sound):
```
E5  E5  G5  E5  D5  C5  B5
|/  |/  |/  |/  |/  |/  |/  |
```

### Chord Positions

Using 6th string root three-note power chords:
- E5: 12-14-14
- G5: 15-17-17
- D5: 10-12-12
- C5: 8-10-10
- B5: 7-9-9

### How to Practice

**Stage 1**: Master the single-note melody (10 minutes)
**Stage 2**: Convert to power chords (10 minutes)
**Stage 3**: Add palm muting for attitude (10 minutes)
**Stage 4**: Play with groove (ongoing)

### The Jack White Philosophy

**This riff teaches**:
- Simplicity is power
- Memorable > complex
- Groove matters more than notes
- Attitude = everything

**You could write this riff.** It's THAT simple.

**The question: Why didn't you?**

**Answer: Because you didn't TRY.**

**Start creating. One of your ideas will stick.**

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: Three-Note Power Chords Buzz on D String

**Symptoms**:
- First two strings clean, third string (octave) buzzes
- Pinky note doesn't ring clearly

**Solutions**:
- Pinky probably not pressing hard enough
- Check pinky angle (perpendicular to fretboard)
- Build pinky strength with dedicated exercises
- Position pinky very close to fret wire
- May take weeks for pinky to catch up to other fingers

### Problem: Created Riffs Sound Generic

**Symptoms**:
- Riffs work technically but lack personality
- Sound like "every other rock song"

**Solutions**:
- Add rhythmic variation (not all straight notes)
- Use unexpected shape changes
- Add pauses (silence is powerful!)
- Listen to diverse rock styles for inspiration
- Don't judge early - create many, keep best

### Problem: Can't Maintain Consistent Palm Muting While Playing Riffs

**Symptoms**:
- Palm mute position shifts
- Some notes muted, some open (unintentionally)

**Solutions**:
- This is THE challenge of riff playing!
- Practice palm mute position without playing first
- Start very slow (40 BPM)
- Mark palm position with visual cue
- Build consistency over weeks
- Even slight inconsistency improves with practice

### Problem: Fingers Get Tangled on Three-Note Chords

**Symptoms**:
- Fingers hit each other
- Can't get all three in position
- Uncomfortable hand position

**Solutions**:
- Check finger order (index-ring-pinky most efficient)
- Ensure fingers approach from above (not sliding in)
- Practice each finger position separately
- Might need to adjust thumb position
- Film your hand to spot issues

## 💬 FINAL ENCOURAGEMENT

### You're Creating Music Now

**This lesson was different** - you didn't just learn technique, you learned to CREATE.

**Every great rock song** started with someone experimenting with power chord combinations, trying different rhythms, and stumbling onto something that sounded good.

**You're doing exactly what Hendrix, Page, Iommi, and Cobain did** - experimenting with power chords to create riffs.

**Your riffs might not be masterpieces yet.** That's okay! Neither were theirs at first.

**The difference between you and them?** They kept creating. They filled notebooks with ideas. They recorded hundreds of riffs and kept the best.

**Do the same.** Create constantly. Record everything. Don't judge too harshly.

**One of your riffs** - maybe today's, maybe next week's, maybe next month's - will be THE RIFF. The one that makes people say "whoa, that's cool!"

**Keith Richards' quote:**

*"I've written thousands of riffs. Maybe 50 were good. Maybe 10 were great. Maybe 3 were '(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction.'"*

**Even legends create lots of forgettable riffs before finding the iconic one.**

**The difference: They never stopped creating.**

**Keep creating. You're a composer now.** 🎸
