# Lesson 7: Foundation Review & Skills Assessment

**⏱️ TYPICAL COMPLETION TIME**: 3-5 days  
**📅 PRACTICE SESSION LENGTH**: 45-60 minutes per session  
**📍 PHASE**: Foundation (Lessons 1-30)  
**🎯 PREREQUISITES**: Lessons 1-6 complete (all seven foundation **chord shapes** mastered)

---

## 🎯 THE GRADUATION MOMENT

**Six lessons ago, you couldn't play anything.**

**Today, you're about to assess what you've become.**

**This isn't just another lesson. This is your CHECKPOINT. Your graduation exam from beginner to foundation-complete guitarist.**

**What you've accomplished:**
- Seven chord shapes mastered
- Two strumming patterns learned
- Shape family concept understood
- Dozens of transitions practiced
- Multiple songs played
- Hundreds of hours of 40-60 BPM tempo discipline

**That's not "learning guitar." That's HAVING LEARNED guitar's foundation.**

**But how do you KNOW you're ready to move forward?**

**That's what today is for.**

---

### Why Assessment Matters

**Without assessment:**
- You guess if you're ready (usually guess "yes" too soon)
- You advance with gaps in foundation
- Future lessons feel impossibly hard
- You wonder why you're struggling
- You blame yourself instead of recognizing incomplete foundation

**With assessment:**
- You KNOW if you're ready (objective metrics)
- You advance with solid foundation
- Future lessons feel challenging but doable
- You progress confidently
- You trust your foundation

**Assessment isn't about judgment. It's about CLARITY.**

---

### The Two Possible Outcomes

**Outcome 1: You meet the standards** (most likely after 6-7 weeks of practice)
- ✅ 50+ BPM on all shape formations
- ✅ 60+ BPM on shape transitions
- ✅ 70+ BPM on strumming patterns
- **Result**: Advance to Lesson 8 with confidence!

**Outcome 2: You don't quite meet the standards** (also normal and fine!)
- Some shapes below 50 BPM
- Transitions below 60 BPM
- Patterns below 70 BPM
- **Result**: Spend 3-5 more days on Lessons 1-6, then reassess

**Both outcomes are GOOD outcomes.**

**Outcome 1** = You're ready, move forward  
**Outcome 2** = You identified gaps, fill them, THEN move forward stronger

**There is NO bad outcome when you assess honestly at proper tempo.**

---

### What Makes This Assessment Different

**Traditional guitar teaching:**
- "Do you feel ready?"
- "Can you sort of play it?"
- "It sounds okay, I guess?"
- Vague, subjective, unhelpful

**Tempo-based assessment:**
- "Can you form D shape cleanly at 50 BPM? Prove it: 10 times in a row."
- "Can you switch Em → Am at 60 BPM? Prove it: 40 switches in 60 seconds."
- "Can you maintain Pattern #1 at 70 BPM? Prove it: 2 minutes straight."
- **Objective, measurable, honest**

**The metronome doesn't lie.**

**It doesn't care about your feelings, your effort, or your intent.**

**It only measures: CAN YOU DO IT AT TEMPO?**

**That's the only question that matters.**

---

### Why Tempo Standards Exist

**50 BPM for shape formation** = slow enough to think, fast enough to prove competence

**60 BPM for transitions** = real-world minimum for song playing

**70 BPM for patterns** = where rhythm actually grooves

**These aren't arbitrary numbers.**

**These are the minimum tempos where skills become FUNCTIONAL.**

**Below these tempos:**
- Shapes feel awkward and tentative
- Transitions disrupt musical flow
- Patterns don't groove yet

**At or above these tempos:**
- Shapes feel confident
- Transitions are musical
- Patterns create groove

**The standards exist to ensure you're FUNCTIONAL, not just "trying."**

---

### The Honest Truth About Assessment

**You might not pass everything on first attempt.**

**That's NORMAL and expected!**

**Most guitarists need:**
- 6-8 weeks to reach these standards (if practicing 30-40 min daily)
- Multiple assessment attempts
- Targeted practice on weak areas
- Patience with the process

**If you've practiced Lessons 1-6 for 6+ weeks at proper tempos:**
- You'll likely pass most assessments
- You'll identify 1-2 areas needing work
- You'll spend a few more days polishing
- **THEN you'll pass everything**

**This is the CORRECT progression.**

**Rushing past gaps = struggling for months**  
**Filling gaps now = confident progress forever**

---

### What This Lesson Includes

**Seven Assessment Categories:**

1. **Individual Shape Formation** (7 shapes × 50 BPM standard)
2. **Shape Transitions** (12 most common transitions × 60 BPM standard)
3. **Strumming Pattern #1** (70 BPM for 2+ minutes)
4. **Strumming Pattern #2** (65 BPM for 2+ minutes)
5. **Complete Song Performance** (70 BPM, start to finish)
6. **Shape Family Understanding** (Can explain Em/E major, Am/A major relationships)
7. **Overall Foundation Confidence** (Self-rating with calibration)

**Each category has:**
- Clear tempo standard
- Specific test procedure
- Pass/needs-work criteria
- Targeted practice recommendations if needed

**By the end, you'll have a complete picture of your skills.**

---

### The Graduation Feeling

**When you pass all assessments:**

You'll know you're ready. Not "hope" you're ready. Not "think" you're ready.

**KNOW.**

**That confidence carries you through the entire curriculum.**

**You'll trust your foundation. You'll tackle new techniques without fear. You'll progress steadily because you built correctly.**

**This assessment gives you that confidence.**

---

### Three Paths Through This Lesson

**Path 1: "I'm confident I'm ready"** (6+ weeks of solid practice)
- Do all assessments in Days 1-2
- Identify any weak areas
- Polish Days 3-4
- Final assessment Day 5
- Advance to Lesson 8!

**Path 2: "I think I'm close but not sure"** (5-6 weeks of practice)
- Do assessments Days 1-2
- Find several areas below standard
- Practice those areas Days 3-7
- Reassess Day 8-10
- Advance when ready

**Path 3: "I know I need more foundation time"** (4-5 weeks of practice, or inconsistent practice)
- Do quick assessment Day 1
- Realize you need more 40-60 BPM work
- Spend 1-2 more weeks on Lessons 1-6
- Return to full assessment
- Advance when actually ready

**All three paths are CORRECT.**

**The wrong path is skipping assessment and advancing with gaps.**

---

### The Promise

**By the end of this lesson:**

✅ You'll know EXACTLY where your skills are  
✅ You'll have objective tempo-based proof  
✅ You'll either advance confidently OR know what to practice  
✅ You'll trust your foundation completely

## 🎯 FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLE: Slow is Smooth, Smooth is Fast

### Assessment = Measuring Your TEMPO Progress

**This lesson is about MEASURING your foundation skills - and tempo is the most objective measurement!**

### **Assessment at proper tempo = Real skill**
### **Assessment at rushed tempo = False confidence**

---

### What This Means for This Lesson

**Minimum Assessment Tempo:** 50-60 BPM (for shape formation and transitions)  
**Target Assessment Tempo:** 60-70 BPM (for ready to advance)  
**Song Performance Tempo:** 70-80 BPM (for complete songs)

**Why tempo matters for assessment:**
- 50 BPM = Can do it correctly
- 60 BPM = Can do it consistently
- 70+ BPM = Can do it in real songs

**Assessment without tempo = vague and unhelpful**
**Assessment with tempo = clear and actionable**

---

### The Science of Assessment

**Real skill = consistency at measurable tempo:**
- You might nail a chord shape once at 80 BPM (luck)
- Can you nail it 10 times in a row at 60 BPM? (skill!)
- Assessment must test CONSISTENCY, not occasional success

**Tempo-based assessment tells you:**
- WHERE you actually are (not where you hope to be)
- WHAT to practice next (specific areas below standard)
- WHEN you're ready to advance (meets minimum tempos)

---

### The Metronome is Your Assessment Tool

**Every assessment in this lesson includes specific BPM standards.**

**Self-assessment without metronome = worthless**
**Self-assessment with metronome = objective truth**

You can FEEL like you're playing well, but the metronome doesn't lie!

**Apps:** Metronome Beats (free), Pro Metronome, Soundbrenner

---

### Minimum Standards for Advancing to Lesson 8

**Shape Formation:** 50 BPM (can form any shape on beat 1)  
**Shape Transitions:** 60 BPM (40+ clean switches per minute)  
**Pattern #1:** 70 BPM (can maintain for 2+ minutes)  
**Pattern #2:** 65 BPM (can maintain for 2+ minutes)  
**Song Performance:** 70 BPM (can play complete song)

**If you don't meet these:** Take 3-5 more days practicing Lessons 1-6 content. This is NORMAL and SMART!

This comprehensive document explains:
- Why tempo-based assessment is objective
- How to honestly evaluate your skills
- When you're actually ready to advance
- Why rushing to next lesson hurts progress

**Remember:** Assessment is not about feeling good - it's about measuring real skill!

**Honest assessment at proper tempo = Real progress**

## 📖 WHAT YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED

### Your Complete Foundation Shape Vocabulary (7 Shapes!)

**As Den Lopez teaches:** "You're not learning random chord fingerings - you're learning SHAPE FAMILIES that will unlock the entire fretboard!"

---

### **Minor Chord Shapes** (darker, introspective sound):

```

---

### 🎯 Why These Are SHAPES (Not Just Chords)

**Traditional Teaching:**
"You learned 7 random chords. Now learn 7 more..."

**Den Lopez Shape Philosophy:**
"You learned 5 SHAPE FAMILIES:
- E-shape (Em + E major)
- A-shape (Am + A major)
- D-shape
- G-shape
- C-shape"

**What this means:**
- You don't have 7 isolated fingerings memorized
- You have 5 PATTERNS that can move and transform
- E-shape at fret 0 = E major, at fret 1 = F major, at fret 3 = G major!
- This is how professionals think!

**The Pattern You've Discovered:**
```
Minor Shape + ONE FINGER = Major Shape

Em shape     + index finger 1st fret  = E major shape
Am shape     + ring finger 2nd fret   = A major shape

ONE FINGER changes the entire emotional quality!
```

**This understanding will make barre chords (Lessons 21-24) feel like "shapes you already know moving up the neck" instead of "impossible new technique!"**

---

### Your Strumming Pattern Vocabulary (2 Patterns!)

**Pattern #1: Down-Up (All Eighth Notes)**
```
Count:  1   &   2   &   3   &   4   &
Strum:  ↓   ↑   ↓   ↑   ↓   ↑   ↓   ↑

Used in: Fast songs, rock, punk, many pop songs
Learned: Lesson 5
Tempo Target: 70+ BPM
```

**Pattern #2: Folk/Pop (With Rests)**
```
Count:  1   &   2   &   3   &   4   &
Strum:  ↓   -   ↓   ↑   ↑   -   ↑   -

Used in: Singer-songwriter style, folk, country, pop ballads
Note: "-" means continue hand motion but don't hit strings
Learned: Lesson 5
Tempo Target: 65+ BPM
```

---

### Shape Families You Understand (Den Lopez Framework)

**The Five Foundation Shape Families:**

**1. E-Shape Family** (THE most important movable family!)
```
Members learned:
- Em shape (Lesson 1)
- E major shape (Lesson 6)

Future expansion:
- E7 shape (Lesson 8)
- F major barre chord = E-shape at 1st fret (Lesson 21)
- G major barre chord = E-shape at 3rd fret (Lesson 21)
- All major/minor barre chords up the neck!
```

**2. A-Shape Family** (Second most important movable family!)
```
Members learned:
- Am shape (Lesson 1)
- A major shape (Lesson 6)

Future expansion:
- A7 shape (Lesson 8)
- B♭ major barre chord = A-shape at 1st fret (Lesson 22)
- C major barre chord = A-shape at 3rd fret (Lesson 22)
- All major/minor barre chords up the neck!
```

**3. D-Shape Family** (Powerful but less movable)
```
Members learned:
- D major shape (Lesson 2)

Why less movable:
- Uses open strings
- Harder to barre than E or A shapes
- But still essential open shape!
```

**4. G-Shape Family** (Strong foundation shape)
```
Members learned:
- G major shape (Lesson 3)

Why important:
- Appears in HUGE percentage of songs
- Partners with C and D shapes constantly
- Advanced: Can become movable (complex technique)
```

**5. C-Shape Family** (Complementary foundation shape)
```
Members learned:
- C major shape (Lesson 3)

Why important:
- Musical "best friend" of G shape
- Appears in most progressions with G
- Beautiful stable sound
```

---

### Songs You Can Play (Real Music!)

**Your Song Repertoire** (songs practiced in Lessons 1-6):

**From Lesson 1:**
- "Horse with No Name" (Em → Am only)

**From Lesson 2:**
- "Knockin' on Heaven's Door" (Em, D, Am progression)

**From Lesson 3:**
- "Let It Be" style progression (uses all five original shapes!)

**From Lesson 5:**
- "Wild Thing" (A, D, E progression - features E major shape!)
- "La Bamba" (C, G, E progression)
- "Love Me Do" (G, C, D, A, E - features A major shape!)

**That's 6+ complete songs you can play!**

---

### What Makes This Foundation Complete

**Most guitar courses at this stage:**
- 3-5 chord shapes (not enough for most songs)
- No understanding of WHY chords work
- No shape philosophy (isolated memorization)
- Limited song repertoire

**YOU have:**
- ✅ 7 chord shapes (5 complete shape families!)
- ✅ Understanding of shape families (movable pattern thinking)
- ✅ Major/minor relationship (one finger changes it!)
- ✅ 2 strumming patterns (can play in rhythm!)
- ✅ 6+ complete songs (real musical performance!)
- ✅ Foundation for barre chords (E and A shapes ready to move!)

**This IS a complete foundation!**

With these seven shapes, you can play:
- Thousands of folk songs
- Hundreds of rock classics
- Countless pop hits
- Traditional country favorites
- Acoustic singer-songwriter material
- Blues standards (with added 7th chords in Lesson 8)

**You're not "sort of" playing guitar. You ARE playing guitar!**

---

## 🔍 SELF-ASSESSMENT: WHERE ARE YOUR SKILLS?

### Assessment Overview

**This section helps you honestly evaluate:**
- Which shapes are strong (ready to advance)
- Which shapes need more work (specific practice needed)
- Which transitions are smooth (can do in songs)

## ✅ FINAL ASSESSMENT: ARE YOU READY FOR LESSON 8?

### The Four-Part Readiness Check

**Review your four assessment scores:**

**1. Shape Formation (Assessment #1):**
- My status: ________________
- Ready? Yes / No / Almost

**2. Shape Transitions (Assessment #2):**
- My status: ________________
- Ready? Yes / No / Almost

**3. Strumming Patterns (Assessment #3):**
- My status: ________________
- Ready? Yes / No / Almost

**4. Song Performance (Assessment #4):**
- My status: ________________
- Ready? Yes / No / Almost

---

### Overall Readiness Decision

**Scenario A: ALL FOUR areas are PROFICIENT or better**
✅ **YOU'RE READY FOR LESSON 8!**
- Congratulations! Your foundation is solid!
- Move to Lesson 8 with confidence
- You've earned this advancement!

---

**Scenario B: 3 areas PROFICIENT, 1 area DEVELOPING**
⚠️ **MOSTLY READY - STRATEGIC PRACTICE NEEDED**
- Identify the one weak area
- Practice that specific area 10 minutes daily for 3-5 days
- Reassess just that area
- When proficient, advance to Lesson 8
- **This is NORMAL!** Most learners have one weak spot.

**My weak area:** ________________

**My practice plan:** ________________

---

**Scenario C: 2+ areas DEVELOPING or NEEDS WORK**
❌ **NOT READY YET - MORE FOUNDATION PRACTICE NEEDED**
- This is OKAY! Foundation takes time!
- Review weak areas specifically:
  - Shape formation issues? → Review Lessons 1-6
  - Transition issues? → One-minute changes daily
  - Strumming issues? → Review Lesson 5, slow down tempo
  - Song performance issues? → Pick simpler song, slower tempo
- Practice 5-7 more days
- Reassess after one week
- **Better to have solid foundation than rush ahead!**

**My weak areas:** ________________

**My practice plan:** ________________

---

### The Honest Truth About Advancing

**Minimum standards exist for YOUR benefit, not to make you feel bad!**

**If you advance before ready:**
- Lesson 8 will be frustrating (7th chords need solid foundation)
- You'll struggle unnecessarily
- You'll have to come back and fix foundation anyway
- Progress actually SLOWER overall

**If you wait until truly proficient:**
- Lesson 8 will feel appropriate (challenging but doable)
- You'll progress smoothly
- Foundation stays solid
- Progress actually FASTER overall

**"Slow is smooth, smooth is fast" applies to advancing between lessons too!**

---

### My Official Decision

**After honest self-assessment, I:**

- [ ] **Am READY for Lesson 8** - All areas proficient or better
- [ ] **Need 3-5 more days of focused practice** - One weak area
- [ ] **Need 7-10 more days of foundation practice** - Multiple weak areas

**Specific areas to work on:** ________________

**My timeline to reassess:** ________________

**My commitment:** I will practice honestly at the speeds needed, not rush, and reassess objectively when ready.

## 🎓 SHAPE FAMILY UNDERSTANDING (Den Lopez Assessment)

### Do You Think in Shapes?

**This section tests your CONCEPTUAL understanding of shape philosophy, not just physical skill.**

---

### Question 1: Minor to Major Transformation

**Scenario:** You're playing Em shape. A song requires E major next.

**Old thinking:** "I need to switch from Em chord to E chord. Let me remember... E is 0-2-2-1-0-0..."

**Shape thinking:** "I'm going from Em SHAPE to E major SHAPE. That's the same shape family - I just add my index finger on G string, 1st fret."

**Which describes your current thinking?**
- [ ] Old thinking (memorizing isolated fingerings)
- [ ] Shape thinking (shape family + one finger)
- [ ] Somewhere in between

**If not shape thinking yet:** Re-read Lesson 4 and Lesson 6 Theory sections. This concept is CRUCIAL for barre chords!

---

### Question 2: Movable Shape Recognition

**Scenario:** You see F major barre chord in a song chart (looks scary!).

**Old thinking:** "Oh no, barre chords! That's a completely new technique I haven't learned yet. I can't play this."

**Shape thinking:** "That's just E major shape moved to 1st fret with a barre. I already know the shape - I just need to learn the barre technique!"

**Which describes your current understanding?**
- [ ] Barre chords seem like entirely new, scary technique
- [ ] I understand they're movable shapes I already know
- [ ] Sort of get it, but still seems hard

**If not shape thinking yet:** Watch Den Lopez video "Open Chords to Barre Chords" - this will click!

---

### Question 3: Major/Minor Pattern Recognition

**Scenario:** A song has both Am and A major. You're switching between them.

**Old thinking:** "These are two different chords with completely different fingerings. Hard to switch between them."

**Shape thinking:** "These are the SAME A-shape with one finger different. Am has ring on 1st fret, A major has ring on 2nd fret. ONE FINGER moves!"

**Which describes how you see Am ↔ A major now?**
- [ ] Two completely different chords
- [ ] Same shape family, one finger different
- [ ] Starting to see it, but not automatic yet

**If not shape thinking yet:** Practice Am ↔ A major 20 times in a row, focusing on WHAT CHANGED (just the ring finger!).

---

### Question 4: Shape Vocabulary Assessment

**Quick test:** Can you name the shape family for each chord below?

**Chords:**
1. Em = ________ shape (minor version)
2. E major = ________ shape (major version)
3. Am = ________ shape (minor version)
4. A major = ________ shape (major version)
5. D major = ________ shape
6. G major = ________ shape
7. C major = ________ shape

**Answers:**
1. E-shape (minor)
2. E-shape (major)
3. A-shape (minor)
4. A-shape (major)
5. D-shape
6. G-shape
7. C-shape

**Score:** ____/7 correct

**7/7 = ✅ SHAPE THINKING MASTERED**
**5-6/7 = ✅ SHAPE THINKING PROFICIENT**
**3-4/7 = ⚠️ SHAPE THINKING DEVELOPING**
**0-2/7 = ❌ SHAPE THINKING NEEDS WORK**

**If not proficient:** Review Lesson 4 Theory section entirely. This is foundational!

---

### Shape Philosophy Summary

**My shape thinking status:** ________________

**Do I need to strengthen this?** Yes / No

**Action needed:** ________________

**Why this matters:**
- Lesson 8: 7th chords are shape variations (E7 = E-shape + one finger change)
- Lessons 21-24: Barre chords are moving shapes you already know
- Lessons 25-28: Lead guitar uses shape positions on fretboard
- **Everything builds on shape thinking!**

---

## 💭 FINAL MOTIVATIONAL NOTE

### You Did It!

**Foundation Phase: COMPLETE!** ✅

**This wasn't easy. You:**
- Pushed through finger pain (calluses built!)
- Practiced slowly when it felt boring (discipline!)
- Repeated exercises hundreds of times (persistence!)
- Trusted the process (patience!)
- Showed up daily (consistency!)

**These qualities are MORE VALUABLE than any chord shapes you learned!**

**The guitar skills are great. The life skills are greater.**

---

### What This Means

**You now have:**
- A solid foundation (7 shapes, 2 patterns)
- Shape thinking (professional mental model)
- Musical capability (can play songs!)
- Proof of discipline (6-7 weeks daily practice)
- Growth mindset (started as complete beginner)

**This foundation will:**
- Support ALL future guitar learning
- Transfer to other skills (proven learning ability!)
- Give you creative outlet (play music!)
- Connect you with others (shared interest!)
- Last your entire life (skill never leaves!)

---

### The Path Ahead

**Expansion Phase (Lessons 8-14):**
- Builds on YOUR foundation
- Adds color and texture
- Expands song repertoire
- Introduces new techniques
- **Gets EASIER, not harder!**

**Why it gets easier:**
- You have solid foundation now
- Finger strength is there
- Calluses make it painless
- You understand shapes (faster learning)
- You trust slow practice (efficient improvement)

**The hardest part is BEHIND YOU!**

---

### Professional Validation

**Every professional guitarist says the same thing:**

"The foundation phase is brutal. Once you get through it, everything else is just building on what you know. The shapes and patterns repeat - you're just applying them in new ways."

**You're through the brutal part!**

**Now comes the FUN part:**
- Learning gets faster
- Progress more obvious
- Songs more complex
- Techniques more interesting
- Playing more enjoyable

---

### Keep Going!

**Momentum is YOUR advantage now!**

**Don't stop. Don't take a break. Keep the momentum!**

**Start Lesson 8 within 2-3 days:**
- Skills are fresh
- Habits are strong
- Confidence is high
- Progress is obvious

**Taking months off = Lose momentum:**
- Skills rust
- Habits break
- Confidence fades
- Have to rebuild foundation

**Strike while iron is hot!**

---

### You're a Guitarist Now

**Not "learning guitar." Not "trying to play guitar."**

**YOU PLAY GUITAR!**

You have:
- 7 chord shapes ✅
- 2 strumming patterns ✅
- 6+ songs ✅
- Shape philosophy ✅
- Performance capability ✅

**That's a guitarist!**

## 🎯 NEXT LESSON PREVIEW

### Lesson 8: Seventh Chords & Blues Foundation

**What's Coming:**
- E7, A7, D7 shapes (adding "color" to your foundation)
- Understanding 7th chord theory (why they sound "bluesy")
- 12-bar blues progression (foundation of blues, rock, jazz)
- Blues strumming patterns (shuffle feel)
- Classic blues songs ("Sweet Home Alabama", "La Grange" style)

**How Today Prepares You:**
- E7 = E major shape + one finger change!
- A7 = A major shape + one finger change!
- D7 = D shape + one finger change!
- **You already know the shapes - just learning variations!**

**Why This is Easier Than Foundation:**
- Not learning new shapes (modifying existing ones)
- One finger addition = simpler than learning from scratch
- Building on solid foundation
- Shape thinking makes it FAST!

**Motivation:**
After Lesson 8, you'll play:
- Blues progressions (universal in rock, country, jazz)
- "Sweet Home Alabama" style songs
- "Mustang Sally" style songs
- Classic rock standards
- **Your song repertoire EXPLODES!**

Blues is the foundation of MOST popular music. Learn blues shapes = unlock hundreds more songs!
