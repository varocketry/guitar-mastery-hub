# Lesson 3: Fourth & Fifth Chord Shapes - G Major & C Major

**⏱️ TYPICAL COMPLETION TIME**: 5-7 days  
**📅 PRACTICE SESSION LENGTH**: 30-40 minutes per session  
**📂 PHASE**: Foundation (Lessons 1-30)  
**🎯 PREREQUISITES**: Lessons 1-2 complete (can play Em, Am, D shapes cleanly at 60 BPM)

---

## 🎯 THE POWER MOMENT: CRITICAL MASS

**This is the lesson that changes everything.**

**Right now, you know three chord shapes:**
- Em shape (minor - sad)
- Am shape (minor - melancholy)
- D shape (major - bright)

**That's good. But it's not quite enough to play most songs.**

**By the end of TODAY, you'll know FIVE chord shapes.**

**And five shapes is the magic number.**

---

### Why Five Shapes is "Critical Mass"

**With five properly-learned shapes, you can play:**
- "Let It Be" - The Beatles
- "Wonderwall" - Oasis
- "Hey Soul Sister" - Train
- "Brown Eyed Girl" - Van Morrison
- "Sweet Home Alabama" - Lynyrd Skynyrd
- "Free Fallin'" - Tom Petty
- "No Woman No Cry" - Bob Marley
- **...and literally HUNDREDS more songs**

**Five shapes = functional guitarist.**

**This is the moment you cross from "someone learning guitar" to "someone who plays guitar."**

---

### What Makes This Lesson Special

**You're learning TWO new shapes today** (G major and C major).

**That might sound intimidating, but here's the secret:**

Both shapes are MAJOR (bright, happy sound). You already understand major vs. minor from Lesson 2. You already know how to form 3-finger shapes from learning D. You already have the finger strength.

**You're not starting from zero.** You're building on what you know.

**And the reward?**

**Complete musical freedom.**

With five shapes at 60 BPM, you can walk into any campfire, any open mic, any jam session and play along with 70% of the songs people know.

**This is your graduation from "beginner" to "guitarist."**

---

### The Songs You'll Play Today

**"Let It Be" by The Beatles** uses all five shapes you'll know:
- C major (new!)
- G major (new!)
- Am (you know!)
- Em (you know!)
- D (you know!)

**By the end of today, you'll play through this complete progression at 40 BPM.**

**That's not "practicing" anymore.** That's PLAYING MUSIC.

---

### What This Moment Means

**Musicians talk about "critical mass" - the point where you have enough vocabulary to actually communicate.**

- One shape = limited
- Two shapes = very limited
- Three shapes = getting there
- **Five shapes = BREAKTHROUGH**

**This is like learning enough words in a foreign language to actually have conversations.**

**Today is that breakthrough.** 🎸

**Let's unlock this power.**

---

## 📖 THEORY: Completing Your Foundation Shape Set

### The Five Core Open Shapes

**After today, you'll know these five shapes:**

1. **Em shape** - Minor, open position (Lesson 1)
2. **Am shape** - Minor, open position (Lesson 1)
3. **D shape** - Major, open position (Lesson 2)
4. **G shape** - Major, open position (TODAY!)
5. **C shape** - Major, open position (TODAY!)

**These five shapes are the foundation of ALL guitar playing.**

---

### Major vs. Minor: Quick Review

**From Lesson 2, you learned:**
- **Minor shapes** = sad, melancholy, introspective (Em, Am)
- **Major shapes** = bright, happy, uplifting (D, G, C)

**Today you're adding two more MAJOR shapes:**
- G major = bright, powerful, strong
- C major = smooth, flowing, sweet

**The emotional palette expands!**

---

### Shape Families (Preview)

**Den Lopez teaches that chord shapes belong to families:**

**The shapes you're learning today:**
- **G-shape family** = G major shape (open position today, movable later)
- **C-shape family** = C major shape (open position today, movable later)

**In Lesson 21, you'll learn to MOVE these shapes** (barre chords). But for now, you're learning them in open position at 40-60 BPM.

**One step at a time. Perfect foundation first.**

---

### The I-IV-V Pattern (Music Theory Gold)

**Fun music theory fact:**

Most pop, rock, country, and folk songs use a pattern called **I-IV-V** (one-four-five).

**In the key of C, that's:**
- I = C (you'll learn today!)
- IV = F (you'll learn later)
- V = G (you'll learn today!)

**In the key of G, that's:**
- I = G (you'll learn today!)
- IV = C (you'll learn today!)
- V = D (you already know!)

**You're literally learning the most important shapes in Western music today.**

---

## 🎯 FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLE: Slow is Smooth, Smooth is Fast

**Before we learn two new shapes, critical reminder:**

### **Slow practice = Fast results**
### **Fast practice = Slow results (and bad habits)**

---

### What This Means for This Lesson

**You're learning TWO shapes today. That's ambitious.**

**The temptation will be to rush. DON'T.**

**Proper approach:**
1. **Learn G shape at 40 BPM** (take your time)
2. **Perfect G shape at 40-50 BPM** (don't rush)
3. **Only then learn C shape** (fresh start)
4. **Perfect C shape at 40-50 BPM** (patience!)
5. **Then combine all five shapes** (gradual integration)

---

### Tempo Guidance for This Lesson

**Week 1: G Major Shape**
```
Days 1-2: G shape at 40 BPM
Days 3-4: G shape at 45-50 BPM
Days 5-6: Add C shape at 40 BPM
Day 7: Both shapes at 50 BPM
```

**Week 2: Integration**
```
Days 8-9: Five-shape combinations at 50 BPM
Days 10-11: "Let It Be" pattern at 50-55 BPM

## 🎸 YOUR FOURTH CHORD SHAPE: G Major

### The G Major Shape (G-Shape)


![G Major Chord](/chord_diagrams/chord_g_L003_01.svg)

**Finger Placement:**
- Middle finger (2): A string, 2nd fret
- Index finger (1): E string (thickest), 3rd fret
- Ring finger (3): high e string (thinnest), 3rd fret
- D, G, and B strings: Play open
- All six strings: Play them all!

**Result:** G - B - D - G - B - G (notes)

**The SHAPE you're learning:**
- Three fingers spread across frets 2-3
- Index on thickest string (E)
- Ring on thinnest string (high e)
- Middle in between (A string)
- Beautiful, full, ringing sound

**This is the G-SHAPE!**

---

### Why G Major Shape is Special

**G major is THE campfire chord:**
- Full, ringing sound (all 6 strings!)
- Bright and powerful
- Central to countless folk and rock songs
- Feels satisfying to play

**Common songs using G shape:**
- "Wonderwall" - Oasis
- "Good Riddance" - Green Day
- "Knockin' on Heaven's Door" - Bob Dylan

**Challenge**: 
- Three fingers spread wide
- Index finger on 3rd fret feels unusual
- Ring finger stretch to high e string
- **This is normal! Takes 3-4 days to feel comfortable at 40 BPM**

---

### Step-by-Step: Forming G Major Shape at 40 BPM

**Method: The "Outside-In" Approach**

**Step 1: Find Your Landmarks at 40 BPM** (30 seconds)
```
Metronome: 40 BPM
Beat 1: Identify low E string (thickest)
Beat 2: Identify high e string (thinnest)
Beat 3: Find 2nd fret
Beat 4: Find 3rd fret
```

**Step 2: Place Index Finger First at 40 BPM** (1 minute)
```
Metronome: 40 BPM
Measure 1:
  Beat 1: Place index on low E string, 3rd fret
  Beats 2-4: Hold and check - close to fret wire?

Measure 2:
  Beat 1: Press firmly
  Beats 2-4: Make sure it's on fingertip

Repeat 5 times at 40 BPM
```

**Step 3: Add Ring Finger at 40 BPM** (1 minute)
```
Metronome: 40 BPM
Measure 1:
  Beat 1: Index on low E, 3rd fret
  Beat 2: Add ring on high e, 3rd fret
  Beats 3-4: Hold both - fingers on opposite ends!

This stretch is the challenge!
Repeat 5 times at 40 BPM
```

**Step 4: Add Middle Finger (Complete Shape) at 40 BPM** (1 minute)
```
Metronome: 40 BPM
Measure 1:
  Beat 1: Index (low E, 3rd fret)
  Beat 2: Ring (high e, 3rd fret)
  Beat 3: Middle (A string, 2nd fret)
  Beat 4: Complete shape!

Middle finger fits naturally between the other two
Repeat 5 times at 40 BPM
```

**Step 5: Strum All Six Strings at 40 BPM** (30 seconds)
```
Metronome: 40 BPM
Beat 1: Complete shape formed
Beat 2: Strum all six strings
Beat 3: Listen to that FULL, POWERFUL sound!
Beat 4: Rest

This is one of the fullest-sounding shapes!
Repeat 5 times at 40 BPM
```

---

### Common Challenges with G Shape

**Challenge 1: Finger spread is wide**
- Normal! This is the widest stretch you've learned
- Your hand will adapt in 3-4 days at 40 BPM
- Don't force it - let flexibility develop naturally

**Challenge 2: Index on 3rd fret feels awkward**
- You've been using 1st-2nd frets mostly
- 3rd fret requires slightly more reach
- Gets comfortable with repetition at 40 BPM

**Challenge 3: Ring finger on high e is tricky**
- Thinnest string, far reach
- Easy to miss or mute adjacent B string
- Practice just this finger placement at 40 BPM

**Remember**: Every guitarist struggled with G shape initially. You're not alone! Proper tempo practice solves this.

### ⏰ NOT READY YET?

**That's completely normal!** This is an ambitious lesson. Most learners spend 10-14 days here.

**If G shape is difficult:**
- Practice "outside-in builder" 5 min daily at 40 BPM
- Finger spread takes 3-4 days to feel comfortable
- Focus on index-ring stretch first
- Then add middle finger

**If C shape is difficult:**
- Practice "diagonal builder" 5 min daily at 40 BPM
- Three adjacent strings requires precision
- Index finger arching is key (don't mute high e!)
- Takes 3-4 days at 40 BPM

**If switches are slow even at 40 BPM:**
- Normal! You're learning 10+ new transitions
- Practice weakest switch 5 minutes daily at 40 BPM
- Use one-minute change exercise
- Speed comes naturally with repetition at proper tempo

**If "Let It Be" feels overwhelming:**
- Practice sections separately at 40 BPM
- Section A (C-G-Am-Em) for 3-4 days
- Section B (D-C-G-C) for 3-4 days
- Then combine at 40 BPM
- Increase tempo gradually (5 BPM every 2 days)

**If hands hurt:**
- You're building strength - normal!
- Practice in 10-minute sessions, 3-4 times daily
- Shake hands between sessions
- Calluses develop in 10-14 days

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: G Shape - Fingers Don't Reach

**Symptoms**:
- Can't stretch index to ring finger comfortably
- Fingers feel strained
- Can't maintain pressure on all three fingers

**Solutions**:

**Solution 1: Hand stretching exercises**
```
Daily stretches (no guitar):
1. Spread fingers wide, hold 10 seconds
2. Gentle finger yoga
3. Repeat 5 times before practice

With guitar at 40 BPM:
1. Just place index and ring (skip middle)
2. Hold stretch for 20 seconds
3. Add middle finger
4. Repeat 10 times daily at 40 BPM
```

**Solution 2: Check hand position**
- ✅ Thumb should be low on back of neck
- ✅ Wrist should be straight (not bent)
- ✅ Elbow should hang naturally
- ✅ Guitar angle affects reach - experiment

**Solution 3: Build gradually at 40 BPM**
```
Week 1: Just get fingers in position (don't worry about sound)
Week 2: Work on making strings ring clearly
Don't rush - flexibility develops naturally with daily practice at 40 BPM
```

---

### Problem: C Shape - Index Finger Mutes High e String

**Symptoms**:
- Five strings sound great, but high e is muted
- Index finger touching both B and e strings
- Can't hear both B (fingered) and e (open)

**Solutions**:

**Solution 1: Arch index finger more**
- ✅ Come down steeper angle on B string
- ✅ Only fingertip touches string, not pad
- ✅ Create space under knuckle

**Solution 2: Index finger positioning at 40 BPM**
```
Metronome: 40 BPM

Measure 1: Place index on B, 1st fret (high arch)
Measure 2: Pluck B string - rings clearly?
Measure 3: Pluck e string - rings clearly?
Measure 4: Adjust if needed

If e is muted: arch index finger MORE
Repeat 10 times at 40 BPM
```

**Solution 3: Complete C shape check**
```
Add middle and ring fingers
Pluck all 5 strings slowly at 40 BPM
If e still muted, reposition just index
Takes 2-3 days to develop the right angle
```

---

### Problem: Switches Between G and C Are Very Slow

**Symptoms**:
- Can form both shapes individually
- But switch takes 5+ seconds
- No common anchor fingers
- Complete finger reorganization needed

**Solutions**:

**Solution 1: This is the hardest switch!**
- ✅ Acknowledge: No common fingers
- ✅ Requires complete hand reformation
- ✅ Takes longer than other switches at 40 BPM
- ✅ Be patient with yourself

**Solution 2: Slow motion practice**
```
No metronome initially:
1. Form G shape
2. Lift all fingers slowly
3. Move to C positions in slow motion
4. Land all fingers simultaneously
5. Repeat 20 times slowly

Then add metronome at 40 BPM:
4 beats to form G, 4 beats to switch to C
```

**Solution 3: Visualization technique at 40 BPM**
```
Metronome: 40 BPM

While playing G:
- Look at fingers
- Picture where they need to go for C
- Mental rehearsal speeds physical transition

G | 1-2-3-4 | (visualize C) | switch | C | 1-2-3-4 |
```

**Solution 4: Daily dedicated practice**
```
5 minutes daily at 40 BPM:
Just practice G to C, C to G
One-minute changes:
Day 1: _____ switches
Day 3: _____ switches
Day 7: _____ switches

You'll see improvement daily!
```

### Problem: Can't Remember Five Shapes

**Symptoms**:
- Confusion about which fingers go where
- Mixing up similar shapes
- Forgetting shapes learned days ago

**Solutions**:

**Solution 1: Shape characteristics chart**
```
Em: 2 fingers, middle strings, 2nd fret
Am: 3 fingers, diagonal, 1st-2nd frets, MINOR
D: 3 fingers, triangle, thin strings only, MAJOR
G: 3 fingers, WIDE spread, all 6 strings, MAJOR
C: 3 fingers, diagonal, skip low E, MAJOR

Create flashcards with these descriptions
```

**Solution 2: Visual memory practice**
```
Metronome: 40 BPM

Daily practice at 40 BPM:
Close eyes, form each shape from memory
Open eyes, check if correct
Repeat until you can form all 5 blindfolded
```

**Solution 3: Muscle memory routine at 40 BPM**
```
Every practice session:
First 5 minutes: Form each shape once at 40 BPM
Em - Am - D - G - C
Say the name as you form it
This reinforcement prevents forgetting
```

**Solution 4: Use them or lose them**
- ✅ Don't just practice - PLAY songs
- ✅ "Let It Be" uses all five
- ✅ Musical context aids memory
- ✅ Your brain remembers shapes better in song context

---

### Problem: "Let It Be" Progression Feels Overwhelming

**Symptoms**:
- Eight shape changes feel like too many
- Can't maintain rhythm through full progression
- Get lost in the sequence

**Solutions**:

**Solution 1: Section practice at 40 BPM**
```
Week 1: Only section A
C | G | Am | Em |
Practice 10 minutes daily at 40 BPM until automatic

Week 2: Only section B
D | C | G | C |
Practice 10 minutes daily at 40 BPM until automatic

Week 3: Combine both sections at 40 BPM
```

**Solution 2: Slow it WAY down**
```
Start at 30 BPM if needed!
8 beats per shape instead of 4
Give yourself time to think
Speed comes later - accuracy first
```

**Solution 3: Use lyrics as guide**
```
Write out the shapes with lyrics:
C               G              Am             Em
"When I find myself in times of trouble..."

Singing helps memorize the sequence
```

**Solution 4: Accept imperfection at 40 BPM**
```
Goal for Week 1: Get through sequence once, however slowly
Goal for Week 2: Get through sequence cleanly at 40 BPM
Goal for Week 3: Increase to 50 BPM
Goal for Week 4: Reach 60 BPM

Don't expect perfection on Day 1!
This progression requires time and patience
```
