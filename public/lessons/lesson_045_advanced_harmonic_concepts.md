## ðŸ“– SECTION 1: SECONDARY DOMINANTS

### What Is a Secondary Dominant?

**Secondary dominant:** A dominant chord that resolves to a chord OTHER than the tonic.

**In simple terms:** Treating a non-tonic chord as if it were temporarily the tonic.

**Remember:**
- In C major, V (G major) resolves to I (C major)
- That's the primary dominant

**Secondary dominants:**
- Treat other chords as temporary tonics
- Create V-I relationships to those chords
- Add color and forward motion

---

### The Most Common: V/V (Five of Five)

**"V/V" = The dominant of the dominant**

**In C Major:**
- V = G major
- What's the dominant of G major? D major
- So V/V = D major

**Progression example:**

**C - D - G - C**

Instead of: C - Dm - G - C (diatonic)

**Analysis:**
- C = I (tonic)
- **D major = V/V** (dominant of G, not in C major diatonically!)
- G = V (dominant, feels like temporary tonic)
- C = I (actual tonic, resolution)

**The D major chord creates temporary focus on G, then G resolves to C.**

---

### Playing V/V on Guitar

**C Major with V/V:**

**C - D - G - C**

```
C:            D:            G:            C:
E|---0---|    E|---2---|    E|---3---|    E|---0---|
B|---1---|    B|---3---|    B|---0---|    B|---1---|
G|---0---|    G|---2---|    G|---0---|    G|---0---|
D|---2---|    D|---0---|    D|---0---|    D|---2---|
A|---3---|    A|-------|    A|---2---|    A|---3---|
E|-------|    E|-------|    E|---3---|    E|-------|
```

**Listen for:**
- C sounds like home
- **D major creates expectation** (not diatonic to C major!)
- G feels like a resolution (temporary tonic)
- C is the final resolution

**This is V/V in action.**

---

### Other Common Secondary Dominants

**V/ii (Dominant of ii):**

In C major: A major → Dm

**Progression: C - A - Dm - G - C**
- A major = V/ii (dominant of Dm)
- Creates temporary focus on Dm

---

**V/vi (Dominant of vi):**

In C major: E major → Am

**Progression: C - E - Am - F - G - C**
- E major = V/vi (dominant of Am)
- Creates temporary focus on Am

---

**V/IV (Dominant of IV):**

In C major: C major → F

**Progression: C - C7 - F - G - C**
- C7 (C major with â™­7) = V/IV (dominant of F)
- Creates temporary focus on F

---

### Why Secondary Dominants Work

**They create temporary key centers:**
- Music doesn't actually modulate (change keys)
- But briefly FEELS like another key
- Adds forward motion and interest
- Creates expectation and resolution

**Used extensively in:**
- Classical music (Bach, Mozart)
- Jazz standards
- Pop music (sophisticated progressions)
- Film scores

---

## ðŸ“– SECTION 2: DIMINISHED SEVENTH CHORDS

### What Is a Diminished Seventh Chord?

**Diminished seventh chord (dim7 or Â°7):**
- Built from stacked minor thirds
- Four notes, all equally spaced
- Extremely tense, unstable sound
- Resolves to nearby chords

---

### Building Diminished Seventh Chords

**Structure:** Root - â™­3 - â™­5 - â™­â™­7 (double flat 7 = 6th)

**B Diminished Seventh (BÂ°7):**
```
B  - D  - F  - Ab
1    â™­3   â™­5   â™­â™­7
```

**Equally spaced minor thirds (3 half steps each):**
```
B → D   = 3 half steps (minor 3rd)
D → F   = 3 half steps (minor 3rd)
F → Ab  = 3 half steps (minor 3rd)
Ab → B  = 3 half steps (minor 3rd) - back to start!
```

**This symmetry is unique.**

---

### The Magic of Diminished Seventh Chords

**Because of the symmetry:**
- BÂ°7 = DÂ°7 = FÂ°7 = AbÂ°7 (all the same notes!)
- Only 3 unique dim7 chords exist (12 notes Ã· 4 = 3)
- Each has 4 names
- Can resolve to multiple places

**This makes dim7 extremely versatile.**

---

### Common Uses of Diminished Seventh

**Use 1: Passing Chord**

Move between two nearby chords smoothly.

**Example in C major:**

**C - C#dim7 - Dm - G - C**
- C = I
- C#dim7 = passing chord (between C and Dm)
- Dm = ii
- Creates smooth chromatic movement

---

**Use 2: Leading Tone Diminished Seventh**

**viiÂ°7 in any key** (built on 7th scale degree)

**In C major: BÂ°7 → C**
- BÂ°7 = B-D-F-Ab
- Resolves strongly to C major
- Creates intense pull to tonic

---

**Use 3: Substitute for V7**

**Diminished seventh can substitute for dominant seventh:**

Instead of G7 → C, use BÂ°7 → C

**Both create strong resolution to C.**

---

### Playing Diminished Seventh Chords

**BÂ°7 (Leading tone in C major):**

```
E|---2---|
B|---3---|
G|---1---|
D|---2---|
A|---2---|
E|-------|
```

**Or (different voicing):**

```
E|-------|
B|-------|
G|---4---|
D|---3---|
A|---2---|
E|---1---|
```

**Use in progression:**

**C - BÂ°7 - C**

Creates tension and resolution.

---

## ðŸ“– SECTION 3: AUGMENTED SIXTH CHORDS

### What Are Augmented Sixth Chords?

**Augmented sixth chords:** Pre-dominant chords containing an augmented sixth interval.

**They strongly pull to the dominant (V).**

**Three types:**
1. **Italian Sixth (It+6)**
2. **French Sixth (Fr+6)**
3. **German Sixth (Gr+6)**

**All resolve to V (dominant).**

---

### The Italian Sixth (It+6)

**In C major, resolving to G (V):**

**Structure: â™­6 - 1 - #4**

In C major: Ab - C - F#

**Creates augmented sixth interval:**
- Ab to F# = augmented sixth (9 half steps)
- Resolves outward: Ab→G, F#→G
- Both notes resolve to G (the dominant)

**Sound:** Dramatic, classical, intense

---

### The French Sixth (Fr+6)

**Adds a major third above the bass:**

**Structure: â™­6 - 1 - 2 - #4**

In C major: Ab - C - D - F#

**Still has augmented sixth (Ab-F#), plus added color (D).**

---

### The German Sixth (Gr+6)

**Adds a perfect fifth above the bass:**

**Structure: â™­6 - 1 - â™­3 - #4**

In C major: Ab - C - Eb - F#

**Most common of the three.**

**Often spelled enharmonically to avoid augmented sixth:**
- Ab - C - Eb - F# (German sixth)
- Or: Ab - C - Eb - Gb (looks like Ab7)

**Functions identically.**

---

### When to Use Augmented Sixth Chords

**Use before the dominant (V):**

**C - Gr+6 - G - C**

Creates dramatic approach to G, then resolution to C.

**Used in:**
- Classical music (Romantic era)
- Film scores (dramatic moments)
- Jazz (sophisticated pre-dominants)
- Prog rock

**Not common in simple pop, but adds sophistication.**

---

## ðŸ“– SECTION 4: THE NEAPOLITAN SIXTH CHORD

### What Is the Neapolitan Sixth?

**Neapolitan sixth (N6 or â™­II6):**
- A major chord built on the lowered second scale degree
- Used in first inversion (6th in bass)
- Pre-dominant function (moves to V or i)
- Exotic, dramatic sound

---

### Building the Neapolitan Sixth

**In C minor:**

**C minor scale:** C - D - Eb - F - G - Ab - Bb - C

**â™­II = Db (lowered 2nd degree)**

**Db major chord: Db - F - Ab**

**In first inversion (6th in bass): F - Ab - Db**
- F in bass (6th of Db)
- Symbol: N6 or â™­II6

---

### Neapolitan Sixth in Progressions

**Common in minor keys:**

**i - N6 - V - i**

**In A minor:**

**Am - Bb/D - E - Am**
- Am = i (tonic)
- Bb in first inversion = N6 (F in bass)
- E = V (dominant)
- Am = i (resolution)

**Creates exotic, dramatic color before the dominant.**

---

### Playing Neapolitan Sixth

**In A Minor:**

**Am - Bb/D - E - Am**

```
Am:           Bb/D:         E:            Am:
E|---0---|    E|---1---|    E|---0---|    E|---0---|
B|---1---|    B|---3---|    B|---0---|    B|---1---|
G|---2---|    G|---3---|    G|---1---|    G|---2---|
D|---2---|    D|---3---|    D|---2---|    D|---2---|
A|---0---|    A|---0---|    A|---2---|    A|---0---|
E|-------|    E|-------|    E|---0---|    E|-------|
```

**Listen for the exotic, dramatic quality before the dominant.**

---

### Why It's Called "Neapolitan"

**Associated with the Neapolitan school of opera (Italy, 1700s).**

Composers like Alessandro Scarlatti used it extensively.

**Now it's a standard classical harmony tool.**

---

## ðŸ“– SECTION 5: ADVANCED VOICE LEADING

### Chromatic Voice Leading

**Moving voices by half steps (chromatically) for smooth connections.**

**Example:**

**C - C#dim7 - Dm**

```
Voice 1: C → C# → D  (chromatic ascent)
Voice 2: E → E  → F  (half step up)
Voice 3: G → G  → A  (whole step up)
```

**Each voice moves smoothly, creating seamless transition.**

---

### Voice Leading with Secondary Dominants

**When using V/V (D major in C major):**

**C - D - G - C**

**Good voice leading:**
```
C chord:  C - E - G
D chord:  D - F# - A  (E→F# is half step)
G chord:  G - B - D   (F#→G, A→B stepwise)
C chord:  C - E - G   (smooth return)
```

**Minimize jumps, maximize stepwise motion.**

---

### Avoiding Parallel Fifths and Octaves

**Classical rule (still relevant):**

Don't move two voices in parallel perfect fifths or octaves.

**Why?** Creates hollow, less rich sound.

**Example of what NOT to do:**

```
Voice 1: C → G (perfect fifth)
Voice 2: G → D (perfect fifth)
Both move up a perfect fifth = parallel fifths
```

**Solution:** Move one voice differently to break parallelism.

---

## ðŸ“– SECTION 6: PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

### Sophisticated Progression Example

**Using multiple advanced concepts:**

**C - A - Dm - Gr+6 - G - C**

**Analysis:**
- C = I (tonic)
- A = V/ii (secondary dominant to Dm)
- Dm = ii (temporary tonic, then subdominant)
- Gr+6 = German sixth (dramatic approach to G)
- G = V (dominant)
- C = I (resolution)

**This progression uses:**
- Secondary dominant (A major)
- Advanced pre-dominant (German sixth)
- Smooth voice leading throughout
- **Graduate-level sophistication**

---

### When to Use Advanced Concepts

**Use secondary dominants when:**
- You want forward motion
- You want to emphasize a non-tonic chord
- You want sophisticated color
- You're writing jazz or classical-influenced music

**Use diminished seventh when:**
- You need a passing chord
- You want tension
- You're creating chromatic voice leading
- You want versatility (can resolve many ways)

**Use augmented sixth/Neapolitan when:**
- You want dramatic approach to dominant
- You're writing classical or film score-inspired music
- You want exotic, sophisticated color
- You want to sound like a master composer

**Don't use when:**
- Simple diatonic sounds better for the song
- Genre doesn't call for sophistication (punk, basic pop)
- It distracts from melody/lyrics

**Advanced harmony is a tool, not a requirement.**

---

## ðŸ“– SECTION 7: PRACTICAL EXERCISES

### Exercise 1: Play Secondary Dominants (20 minutes)

**In C Major, play these progressions:**

1. **C - D - G - C** (V/V)
2. **C - A - Dm - G - C** (V/ii)
3. **C - E - Am - F - G - C** (V/vi)

**Listen for how each secondary dominant creates temporary focus.**

---

### Exercise 2: Use Diminished Seventh Passing Chords (15 minutes)

**Add dim7 between diatonic chords:**

**C - C#dim7 - Dm - G - C**

**G - G#dim7 - Am - D - G**

**Notice the smooth chromatic voice leading.**

---

### Exercise 3: Experiment with Neapolitan Sixth (20 minutes)

**In A Minor:**

**Am - Bb/D - E - Am**

**In E Minor:**

**Em - F/A - B - Em**

**Notice the exotic, dramatic quality.**

---

### Exercise 4: Analyze a Jazz Standard (25 minutes)

**Listen to "Autumn Leaves" or another jazz standard.**

**Identify:**
- Secondary dominants (there are many!)
- Diminished passing chords
- ii-V-I progressions in multiple keys

**Jazz is FULL of these concepts.**
