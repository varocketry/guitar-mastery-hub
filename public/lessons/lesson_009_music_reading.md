# Lesson 9: Introduction to Music Reading for Guitarists


## 🎯 BREAKING FREE FROM LIMITATIONS

**Right now, you can play dozens of songs.**

**But there's a problem:**

**Someone has to SHOW you how to play them.**

**You need:**
- YouTube tutorials
- Someone to demonstrate
- Trial and error guessing
- Memorizing exact fingerings

**What you CAN'T do:**
- Look at written music and just PLAY it
- Learn songs independently at any time
- Understand what other guitarists write down
- Document your own musical ideas
- Communicate with other musicians in writing

**This is like being able to speak but not read.**

**Functional? Yes. Limited? Absolutely.**

**Today, you learn to READ.**

---

### The Freedom Reading Gives You

**After today, you'll be able to:**

✅ **Go to Ultimate-Guitar.com** and read any song  
✅ **Look at tablature** and know exactly what to play  
✅ **See a chord chart** and understand the structure  
✅ **Read rhythm notation** and play timing correctly  
✅ **Write down your own ideas** so you don't forget them  
✅ **Communicate with other musicians** through notation

**This isn't about becoming a music theory expert.**

**This is about INDEPENDENCE.**

**Independence to learn what you want, when you want, without waiting for someone to show you.**

---

### Why Guitarists Need Different Reading Skills

**Classical musicians read:** Standard notation (staff, notes, rhythms)  
**Guitarists read:** Tablature + chord charts + lead sheets

**Why the difference?**
- Guitar has 6 strings with duplicate notes (same note, different positions)
- Standard notation doesn't tell you WHERE to play it
- Tablature shows EXACTLY where to put your fingers
- Much faster to learn, specifically designed for guitar

**You're not learning to read like a pianist.**

**You're learning to read like a GUITARIST.**

**Different tool. Same goal: independence.**

---

### The Three Reading Systems You're Learning

**System 1: Tablature (TAB)** - Where to put your fingers
```
e|---0---1---3---
B|---0---0---0---
G|---0---0---0---
D|---2---2---2---
A|---2---3---2---
E|---0---X---X---
```
- Shows exact fret numbers
- Shows exact strings
- Universal guitar language
- Used on Ultimate-Guitar, Songsterr, all guitar sites

**System 2: Chord Diagrams** - Visual shape reference
```
  Em    Am    D
e|-0-  -0-  -2-
B|-0-  -1-  -3-
G|-0-  -2-  -2-
D|-2-  -2-  -0-
A|-2-  -0-  ---
E|-0-  ---  ---
```
- Quick visual reference
- Shows finger positions
- Standard across all guitar materials

**System 3: Lead Sheets** - Song structure + chords + lyrics
```
Verse:
    Em              C
"When I find myself in times of trouble..."
    G               D
"Mother Mary comes to me..."
```
- Combines lyrics + chords + timing
- Most common format for song learning
- Used in real performance situations

**Learn these three, and you can read 95% of guitar music.**

---

### The Reality: Reading is NOT Instant

**Fair warning:** You won't sight-read fluently today.

**Reading development timeline:**
- **Day 1-2**: Understand the symbols (what everything means)
- **Week 1**: Read slowly with frequent pauses (40 BPM)
- **Month 1**: Read simple songs with some fluency (60 BPM)
- **Month 3**: Read most material without much struggle
- **Month 6-12**: Read fluently, minimal hesitation

**This is NORMAL and expected.**

**Comparison:**
- Learning to PLAY guitar = 6-8 weeks to foundation
- Learning to READ guitar = 3-6 months to fluency

**Reading is a separate skill that develops alongside playing.**

**Today you start. Fluency comes with time.**

---

### Why This Lesson is Different

**Lessons 1-8 focused on:** Physical technique (how to move hands)

**Lesson 9 focuses on:** Visual-mental skill (interpreting symbols)

**This is MORE like learning a language than learning a sport.**

**You're training your brain to:**
- Recognize symbols instantly
- Convert symbols to finger positions
- Do this conversion WHILE playing at tempo

**It's complex. It takes time. It's worth it.**

---

### The Hidden Benefit: Understanding Music Better

**Reading teaches you:**
- How songs are structured (verse-chorus-bridge)
- How timing and rhythm work (beats, measures, time signatures)
- How chord progressions function (I-IV-V patterns)
- How melodies relate to chords (music theory preview)

**You won't just be able to read.**

**You'll UNDERSTAND music at a deeper level.**

**This understanding makes you a better player, even when you're not reading.**

---

### Songs You'll Learn to Read

**Simple TAB examples:**
- "Smoke on the Water" - Deep Purple (famous riff)
- "Seven Nation Army" - The White Stripes (iconic bass line)
- "Sunshine of Your Love" - Cream (classic rock)

**Chord chart reading:**
- "Let It Be" - The Beatles
- "Wonderwall" - Oasis  
- "Hey Soul Sister" - Train

**Lead sheet reading:**
- Any song from Ultimate-Guitar
- Any song from real books
- Any song another musician hands you

**By end of lesson, you'll READ these, not just memorize them.**

---

### The Practice Approach at 40 BPM

**Reading requires EXTREMELY slow practice:**

**40 BPM** = Your brain has time to:
- Look at symbol
- Identify what it means
- Find finger position
- Execute movement
- Move to next symbol

**This feels GLACIALLY slow. Practice anyway.**

**Why?**
- Reading is visual processing + motor execution
- Both must happen before tempo increases
- Your brain literally creates new neural pathways
- These pathways need SLOW repetition to form

**Fast reading comes from slow practice. No exceptions.**

---

### The Long-Term View

**Today**: Learn the symbols, read VERY slowly  
**This week**: Read simple patterns at 40 BPM  
**Next month**: Read chord charts fluently  
**Three months**: Read most TAB comfortably  
**Six months**: Read without thinking about it

**This is a MARATHON skill, not a SPRINT skill.**

**But once you have it? You have it FOREVER.**

---

### The Promise

**By the end of this lesson:**

✅ You'll understand TAB, chord charts, and lead sheets  
✅ You'll read simple songs slowly but accurately  
✅ You'll know WHERE to find guitar music online  
✅ You'll document your own ideas in writing  
✅ You'll be independent in your learning

**You'll cross from "can play what I'm shown" to "can learn anything independently."**

**That's true musical freedom.**

**Let's learn to read.** 🎸

## 🎯 FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLE: Slow is Smooth, Smooth is Fast

**The most important rule in guitar learning:**

### **Slow practice = Fast results**
### **Fast practice = Slow results (and bad habits)**

---

### What This Means for This Lesson

**When learning to read music:**

1. **Start at 40 BPM** (will feel VERY slow - that's correct!)
2. **Read ACCURATELY at slow speed** (every note correct, every rhythm precise)
3. **Only increase when perfect** (if you make 2+ mistakes, tempo is too fast)
4. **Use 5 BPM increments** (not 20-30 BPM jumps)

---

### Why This Works for Reading

**Your brain learns what you practice:**
- Practice reading fast with mistakes = learn to read inaccurately (bad habits locked in)
- Practice reading slow with accuracy = learn to read fluently (correct patterns)

**Reading fluency is a byproduct of accuracy, not speed.**

**Think of it like learning a new language:**
- You don't start by speed-reading Shakespeare
- You start with simple sentences, read slowly, build fluency gradually
- Same with music reading!

---

### The Metronome is Your Best Friend

**Every reading exercise in this lesson includes starting tempos.**

**The metronome is NOT OPTIONAL for rhythm reading.**

- Every great sight-reader uses one
- Every struggling reader doesn't
- Don't be the one who stays stuck

**Apps:** Metronome Beats (free), Pro Metronome, Soundbrenner

---

### Tempo Progression for This Lesson

**Week 1: Building Accuracy**
```
Days 1-2: 40 BPM (single-note reading)
Days 3-4: 50 BPM (chord shape reading)
Days 5-6: 60 BPM (rhythm patterns)
Day 7: Test at 70 BPM
```

**Week 2: Building Fluency**
```
Continue adding 5 BPM every 2 days
Target: 80-90 BPM by end of lesson
```

**CRITICAL RULE:** If you make more than 2 mistakes at new tempo, drop back 5 BPM and practice there for 2 more days.

---

### "But I Just Want to Read, Not Play!" - WRONG APPROACH

**Real talk about reading:**

Reading music is NOT a separate skill from playing - it's integrated. You need to:
1. **See** the notation (visual recognition)
2. **Process** what it means (mental translation)
3. **Execute** the physical movement (motor skill)
4. **Hear** the result (ear training)

**All four must happen at tempo for true fluency.**

**If you practice reading at 120 BPM and make mistakes:**
- Your brain learns to read inaccurately
- You develop bad recognition patterns
- You'll always struggle with sight-reading

**If you practice reading at 40 BPM and get everything right:**
- Your brain learns accurate pattern recognition
- Reading becomes automatic
- Speed builds naturally

**Slow reading today = Fast reading tomorrow!**

---

### For Complete Details

**See:** Practice Philosophy: Slow is Smooth, Smooth is Fast

**This document explains:**
- The science behind slow practice
- How pattern recognition forms
- Speed ladder technique
- Common mistakes and solutions
- Real-world examples
- When to increase tempo

---

**Remember:** Every exercise in this lesson includes explicit tempo guidance. FOLLOW IT!

**Your job:** Read accurately at slow tempo TODAY. Let tomorrow's you read at faster tempo.

## 📖 THEORY: Why Learn to Read Music as a Guitarist?

### The Great News: Guitarists Have It Easy!

**Here's a secret:** You DON'T need to learn traditional music notation (the kind with treble clefs and key signatures) to be an excellent guitarist!

**Traditional Staff Notation** (what piano and orchestra musicians use):
```
𝄞 Lines, spaces, note heads, stems, clefs, key signatures
```
- Complex system (takes years to master)
- Requires understanding music theory
- Not commonly used in rock, pop, folk, or blues guitar
- More relevant for classical guitar or jazz

**Guitar-Specific Notation** (what 95% of guitarists use):
- Tablature (TAB) - visual fretboard map
- Chord diagrams - pictures of where fingers go
- Rhythm notation - simple timing marks
- Lead sheets - chord shapes with lyrics

**The reality:** Most professional rock, pop, and folk guitarists use TAB and chord charts, NOT traditional notation!

### Why Bother Learning to Read at All?

**Valid question!** Many great guitarists play "by ear" and never read music. So why learn?

**Practical Benefits:**
1. **Access to thousands of free songs online** - Ultimate Guitar, Songsterr, etc.
2. **Learn songs faster** - Don't need to watch 20-minute YouTube tutorials
3. **Remember your own ideas** - Write down riffs and progressions you create
4. **Communicate with other musicians** - Universal language
5. **Independence** - Not dependent on finding the perfect video lesson
6. **Understand lessons better** - Many tutorials use TAB/diagrams
7. **Expand your repertoire** - Unlock songs without perfect tutorials

**What Reading DOESN'T Replace:**
- Playing by ear (different skill - both are valuable!)
- Improvisation and creativity
- Feel and groove
- Musical expression
- Having fun playing guitar!

**The Bottom Line:** Reading music is a TOOL in your toolbox, not a requirement for enjoying guitar. But it's a very useful tool that takes just a few days to learn!

## 🎸 READING METHOD #1: TABLATURE (TAB)

### What is Tablature?

**Tablature (TAB)** is a visual representation of the guitar fretboard that shows you EXACTLY where to put your fingers - no guesswork, no theory required!

**Why TAB is Perfect for Guitar:**
- Shows precise finger placement
- Works for any tuning
- Quick to learn (hours, not years)
- Used universally online
- Perfect for riffs, solos, and fingerstyle
- No need to know note names

### TAB Structure: Six Lines = Six Strings

**Basic TAB looks like this:**
```
e|-------------------------------------------
B|-------------------------------------------
G|-------------------------------------------
D|-------------------------------------------
A|-------------------------------------------
E|-------------------------------------------
```

**Those 6 lines represent your 6 guitar strings:**
- **e** (top line) = 1st string (thinnest, high E)
- **B** = 2nd string
- **G** = 3rd string
- **D** = 4th string
- **A** = 5th string
- **E** (bottom line) = 6th string (thickest, low E)

**CRITICAL ORIENTATION POINT:**

When you look DOWN at your guitar while playing:
- Thickest string (low E) is CLOSEST to your face
- Thinnest string (high e) is FARTHEST from your face

But in TAB:
- Thinnest string (high e) is at the TOP
- Thickest string (low E) is at the BOTTOM

**TAB is "upside down" from your playing view!** This confuses beginners at first - that's normal!

### Reading Numbers in TAB

**Numbers tell you which fret to press:**

**0** = Open string (no finger, just pluck the string)
**1** = 1st fret
**2** = 2nd fret
**3** = 3rd fret
... and so on up the fretboard

**X** = Don't play this string (mute it or skip it)

**Example: C-Shape in TAB**
```
e|---0---
B|---1---
G|---0---
D|---2---
A|---3---
E|---X---
```

**How to read this:**
- High e string: Play open (0)
- B string: Press 1st fret
- G string: Play open (0)
- D string: Press 2nd fret
- A string: Press 3rd fret
- Low E string: Don't play (X)

**You already know this shape!** You've been playing the C-shape since Lesson 3. Now you can read it in TAB!

### Reading Single Notes in TAB (Melodies and Riffs)

**When numbers appear in a LINE (not stacked), play them one at a time from left to right:**

```
e|---0---1---3---5---7---8---
B|---------------------------
G|---------------------------
D|---------------------------
A|---------------------------
E|---------------------------
```

**This means:**
- Play high e string open (0)
- Then 1st fret
- Then 3rd fret
- Then 5th fret
- Then 7th fret
- Then 8th fret

**Read TAB like you read English:** Left to right!

---

### Exercise 1: First TAB Reading Practice (10 minutes)

**Simple Single-Note Exercise on High e String**

**Tempo:** 40 BPM (yes, THAT slow!)

```
e|---0---2---3---2---0------|
B|-------------------------|
G|-------------------------|
D|-------------------------|
A|-------------------------|
E|-------------------------|
```

**Instructions:**
1. Set metronome to 40 BPM
2. Play one note per click
3. Read left to right: 0 (open), 2nd fret, 3rd fret, 2nd fret, 0 (open)
4. Repeat 10 times until smooth
5. Can you increase to 45 BPM and stay accurate?

**Goal:** Develop muscle memory for reading and playing simultaneously at slow, controlled tempo.

---

### Exercise 2: Two-String Pattern (10 minutes)

**Now we'll read across two strings:**

**Tempo:** 40 BPM

```
e|---0---1---3----------|
B|-------------0---1----|
G|----------------------|
D|----------------------|
A|----------------------|
E|----------------------|
```

**Instructions:**
1. Keep metronome at 40 BPM
2. Play: high e open, 1st fret, 3rd fret, then B string open, 1st fret
3. Notice how TAB shows string changes visually
4. Repeat until smooth
5. Increase tempo by 5 BPM when perfect

**Common Mistake:** Rushing between strings. Keep steady tempo!

---

### Reading Chord Shapes in TAB

**When numbers are STACKED vertically, play them all at once (a chord shape!):**

```
e|---0---
B|---1---
G|---0---
D|---2---
A|---3---
E|---X---
```

**This is a stacked formation = C-shape (all notes together)!**

**How to read stacked numbers:**
1. Form the entire shape with all fingers
2. Strum all strings (except X) at once
3. One strum = one chord shape

---

### Exercise 3: Reading Chord Shape Sequence (15 minutes)

**Let's read a progression you already know - Em, Am, D!**

**Tempo:** 50 BPM (4 beats per shape)

```
Em-shape        Am-shape        D-shape         Em-shape
e|---0---|       e|---0---|      e|---2---|      e|---0---|
B|---0---|       B|---1---|      B|---3---|      B|---0---|
G|---0---|       G|---2---|      G|---2---|      G|---0---|
D|---2---|       D|---2---|      D|---0---|      D|---2---|
A|---2---|       A|---0---|      A|---X---|      A|---2---|
E|---0---|       E|---X---|      E|---X---|      E|---0---|

(Strum 4 times)  (Strum 4 times)  (Strum 4 times)  (Strum 4 times)
```

**Instructions:**
1. Set metronome to 50 BPM
2. Form Em-shape, strum on beats 1, 2, 3, 4
3. Switch to Am-shape, strum on beats 1, 2, 3, 4
4. Continue pattern
5. Focus on reading the TAB, not just playing from memory!

**Reading Goal:** Eventually you should be able to see stacked TAB and immediately form the shape without thinking.

---

### TAB Symbols You'll See Online

**Additional symbols (you'll encounter these on Ultimate Guitar, etc.):**

**Slides:**
```
e|---3/5---  (slide from 3rd to 5th fret)
e|---5\3---  (slide from 5th to 3rd fret)
```

**Hammer-ons (we'll learn this technique later):**
```
e|---0h2---  (play open, then hammer finger down on 2nd fret)
```

**Pull-offs:**
```
e|---2p0---  (play 2nd fret, pull finger off to open string)
```

**Bends:**
```
e|---7b9---  (play 7th fret, bend string up to pitch of 9th fret)
```

**Don't worry about these symbols yet!** Just be aware they exist. Focus on reading basic numbers and stacked formations for now.

---

### Exercise 4: Simple Riff Reading (15 minutes)

**"Smoke on the Water" Opening (Simplified)**

**Everyone knows this riff! Let's read it in TAB:**

**Tempo:** 60 BPM

```
G|---0---3---5---|---0---3---6---5---|---0---3---5---|---3---0---|
D|---------------|-------------------|---------------|-----------|
```

**Instructions:**
1. Set metronome to 60 BPM
2. Read and play on G string only
3. One note per beat
4. Repeat until smooth at this tempo
5. Gradually increase to 80 BPM over several days

**This is the power of TAB:** Even complex-sounding riffs become readable once you understand the system!

---

## 🎸 READING METHOD #2: CHORD DIAGRAMS

### What Are Chord Diagrams?

**Chord diagrams** (also called chord boxes or chord charts) are visual pictures of the guitar neck showing exactly where to place your fingers for a chord shape.

**Why They're Useful:**
- Quick visual reference
- Show exact finger placement
- Universal format (used everywhere)
- Easier to read than TAB for shapes
- Perfect for beginners

### Anatomy of a Chord Diagram

**Here's what you see:**

```
   E A D G B e  ← String names
   "───────────
   │ │ │ │ │ │  ← Nut (top of fretboard)
   ├───────────  Fret 1
   │ │ │ │ │ │
   ├───────────  Fret 2
   │ │ │ │ │ │
   ├───────────  Fret 3
   │ │ │ │ │ │
```

**Components:**
- **Vertical lines** = Strings (6 of them)
- **Horizontal lines** = Frets
- **Dots** = Where to place fingers
- **Numbers on dots** = Which finger to use
- **O** above string = Play open (no finger)
- **X** above string = Don't play this string

---

### How to Read Chord Diagrams

**Example: Em-Shape**

```
Em-shape
    E A D G B e
    O O • • O O  ← O = open, • = play
    │ │ │ │ │ │
    ├───────────
    │ 2 3 │ │ │  ← Numbers = which finger
    ├───────────
    │ │ │ │ │ │
    ├───────────
```

**How to read this:**
- **E string:** Open (O)
- **A string:** 2nd fret with middle finger (2)
- **D string:** 2nd fret with ring finger (3)
- **G, B, e strings:** All open (O)

**You know this shape!** This is the Em-shape from Lesson 1!

---

### Exercise 5: Reading Chord Diagrams (10 minutes)

**Let's read all the shapes you know as diagrams:**

**Am-Shape:**
```
Am-shape
    E A D G B e
    X O • • • O
    │ │ │ │ │ │
    ├───────────
    │ │ 2 3 1 │
    ├───────────
    │ │ │ │ │ │
```

**D-Shape:**
```
D-shape
    E A D G B e
    X X O • • •
    │ │ │ │ │ │
    ├───────────
    │ │ │ 1 3 2
    ├───────────
    │ │ │ │ │ │
```

**G-Shape:**
```
G-shape
    E A D G B e
    • O O O • •
    │ │ │ │ │ │
    ├───────────
    │ │ │ │ │ │
    ├───────────
    3 │ │ │ 4 4
```

**C-Shape:**
```
C-shape
    E A D G B e
    X • • O • O
    │ │ │ │ │ │
    ├───────────
    │ 3 2 │ 1 │
    ├───────────
    │ │ │ │ │ │
```

**Instructions:**
1. Look at each diagram
2. Form the shape on your guitar
3. Check: Does your fingering match the diagram?
4. Strum and listen
5. Can you "read" the diagram and form the shape without thinking?

**Goal:** Develop instant shape recognition from diagrams.

---

### Reading Diagrams for New Shapes

**This is where diagrams become incredibly useful!**

**When you encounter a NEW shape online:**
1. Look at the diagram
2. See which strings to play (O and dots)
3. See which strings to mute (X)
4. See which fingers go where (numbers)
5. Form the shape slowly
6. Strum and check sound

**Example: Let's learn a NEW shape - E-Shape (full version)!**

```
E-shape
    E A D G B e
    O • • • O O
    │ │ │ │ │ │
    ├───────────
    │ 2 3 1 │ │
    ├───────────
    │ │ │ │ │ │
```

**How to read this:**
- **E string:** Open (O)
- **A string:** 2nd fret, middle finger (2)
- **D string:** 2nd fret, ring finger (3)
- **G string:** 1st fret, index finger (1)
- **B string:** Open (O)
- **e string:** Open (O)

**This is E major - the full E-shape!** (You've already learned part of this shape as Em-shape in Lesson 1)

---

### Exercise 6: Reading E-Shape from Diagram (10 minutes)

**Form the E-shape by reading the diagram:**

**Tempo:** Not applicable yet (just formation practice)

**Instructions:**
1. Look at E-shape diagram above
2. Form the shape on your guitar
3. Check each finger matches diagram
4. Strum all 6 strings
5. Listen: Bright, full sound (that's E major!)
6. Release and re-form 10 times

**Reading Goal:** Can you look at the diagram and form E-shape in under 5 seconds?

**Note:** We'll explore E-shape more in Lesson 10. For now, just practice reading the diagram!

---

## 🎸 READING METHOD #3: RHYTHM NOTATION

### Why Rhythm Notation Matters

**You can read TAB and chord diagrams, but when do you strum?**

That's where rhythm notation comes in!

**Rhythm notation shows:**
- When to strum
- How long to hold each shape
- Strumming patterns (down vs up)
- Timing and beats

### Basic Rhythm Symbols

**Most common symbols you'll see:**

```
/  = Downstroke (strum down)
^  = Upstroke (strum up)
.  = Rest (don't strum, pause)
-  = Hold (sustain the sound)
>  = Accent (strum louder/harder)
```

**Example rhythm pattern:**
```
Em-shape
/  /  /  /
1  2  3  4

(Four downstrokes, one per beat)
```

---

### Reading Rhythm Patterns with TAB

**Combined TAB and rhythm notation:**

```
Em-shape                Am-shape
e|---0---|              e|---0---|
B|---0---|              B|---1---|
G|---0---|              G|---2---|
D|---2---|              D|---2---|
A|---2---|              A|---0---|
E|---0---|              E|---X---|
  /  /  /  /              /  /  /  /
  1  2  3  4              1  2  3  4
```

**How to read this:**
- Form Em-shape
- Strum down on beats 1, 2, 3, 4
- Form Am-shape
- Strum down on beats 1, 2, 3, 4

---

### Exercise 7: Reading Rhythm Notation (15 minutes)

**Simple Down-Strum Pattern:**

**Tempo:** 60 BPM

```
Em-shape        Am-shape        D-shape         Em-shape
/  /  /  /      /  /  /  /      /  /  /  /      /  /  /  /
1  2  3  4      1  2  3  4      1  2  3  4      1  2  3  4
```

**Instructions:**
1. Set metronome to 60 BPM
2. Form Em-shape
3. Strum DOWN on each beat (metronome click)
4. Switch to Am-shape after 4 beats
5. Continue pattern
6. Focus on reading the rhythm marks, not just playing from memory!

**Goal:** Your strums should line up perfectly with metronome clicks.

---

### Reading Down-Up Strumming Patterns

**Most songs use down-up patterns for rhythm:**

```
C-shape
/  ^  /  ^  /  ^  /  ^
1  &  2  &  3  &  4  &

(Down on beats, up on "ands")
```

**How to count this:**
- **1** = Down (on the beat)
- **&** = Up (between beats, called "and")
- **2** = Down
- **&** = Up
- Continue...

---

### Exercise 8: Reading Down-Up Rhythm (15 minutes)

**Classic Down-Up Pattern:**

**Tempo:** 50 BPM (slower to learn pattern)

```
Em-shape                        Am-shape
/  ^  /  ^  /  ^  /  ^         /  ^  /  ^  /  ^  /  ^
1  &  2  &  3  &  4  &         1  &  2  &  3  &  4  &
```

**Instructions:**
1. Set metronome to 50 BPM
2. Count out loud: "1-and-2-and-3-and-4-and"
3. Strum down on numbers, up on "and"
4. Keep hand moving in continuous down-up motion
5. Repeat until smooth
6. Increase tempo by 5 BPM when comfortable

**Common Mistake:** Stopping hand motion between strums. Keep your hand moving constantly in down-up motion, even if not hitting strings every time.

---

### Reading Accent Marks

**Accent marks (>) tell you to strum LOUDER:**

```
Em-shape
/  /  >  /
1  2  3  4

(Strum harder on beat 3)
```

**This creates rhythm and dynamics!**

---

### Exercise 9: Reading Accents (10 minutes)

**Accented Pattern:**

**Tempo:** 60 BPM

```
Em-shape                Am-shape                D-shape
/  ^  >  ^  /  ^  /  ^  /  ^  >  ^  /  ^  /  ^  /  ^  >  ^  /  ^  /  ^
1  &  2  &  3  &  4  &  1  &  2  &  3  &  4  &  1  &  2  &  3  &  4  &
```

**Instructions:**
1. Metronome at 60 BPM
2. Play down-up pattern
3. Strum LOUDER on beat 2 (marked with >)
4. This creates a rhythmic emphasis
5. Listen to how accents change the feel of the pattern

**Goal:** Develop dynamic control - not every strum should be the same volume!

---

## 🎸 READING METHOD #4: LEAD SHEETS

### What Are Lead Sheets?

**Lead sheets** combine chord symbols with lyrics - this is how most pop/rock/folk songs are shared online!

**Example Lead Sheet:**

```
"Horse with No Name" - America

Intro: Em | D | Em | D |

Verse:
Em                    D
On the first part of the journey
Em                      D
I was looking at all the life
Em                            D
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
Em                      D
There was sand and hills and rings

Chorus:
Em                 D
I've been through the desert on a
Em                    D
Horse with no name...
```

**How to read this:**
- **Chord symbols** (Em, D) tell you which shape to play
- **Lyrics** tell you when to change shapes
- **Vertical alignment** shows exact timing (shape changes when new symbol appears above lyric)

---

### Interpreting Lead Sheets

**What lead sheets DON'T tell you:**
- Specific strumming pattern (you choose!)
- How many times to strum each shape (feel it out!)
- Tempo (listen to recording for reference)
- Exact rhythm (use your ear!)

**What lead sheets DO tell you:**
- Which shapes to play (chord symbols)
- When to change shapes (aligned with lyrics)
- Song structure (verse, chorus, bridge, etc.)
- Order of sections

**This is where your strumming skills from Lessons 5 and 8 come in!**

---

### Exercise 10: Reading Your First Lead Sheet (20 minutes)

**"Stand By Me" - Ben E. King (Simplified)**

**Tempo:** 70 BPM
**Strumming:** Use Pattern 1 from Lesson 5 (D D U U D U)

```
Verse:
G                    G
When the night has come
        Em               Em
And the land is dark
        C                D              G
And the moon is the only light we'll see

G                    G
No I won't be afraid
        Em               Em
Oh I won't be afraid
        C                D              G
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

Chorus:
           G
So darling, darling,
              G
Stand by me,
           Em
Oh stand by me
           C        D           G
Oh stand, stand by me, stand by me
```

**Instructions:**
1. Set metronome to 70 BPM
2. Read through once without playing (just see shape changes)
3. Form each shape as you read the lyrics
4. Strum Pattern 1 for each shape
5. Change shapes where new chord symbols appear
6. Sing or hum along if you know the song!

**Reading Goal:** Can you follow the lead sheet and play through without stopping?

**Note:** Don't worry about perfection! The goal is reading and following the sheet, not flawless performance.

---

### Lead Sheet Tips

**When you find lead sheets online:**

**Good sources:**
- Ultimate Guitar (most common, free)

**How to use them effectively:**
1. Read through entire sheet first (identify shapes you know vs. unknown)
2. Mark difficult shape changes
3. Practice transitions slowly
4. Listen to original recording for rhythm reference
5. Start at 50% tempo, gradually increase
6. Don't worry about exact match to recording - close is good enough!

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: TAB Looks Upside-Down

**Symptoms:**
- Confused about which line is which string
- Playing on wrong strings
- Can't orient the six lines to your guitar

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Physical reminder**
- Look at your guitar
- High e (thinnest) is at the BOTTOM when you look down
- But in TAB, high e is at the TOP
- This is STANDARD - it's meant to be read facing you, not overhead view

**Solution 2: Use labels**
- Always check string labels (E, A, D, G, B, e) on TAB
- High e is top line, low E is bottom line
- When in doubt, reference labels

**Solution 3: Practice simple exercises**
- Do Exercise 1 repeatedly (single string on high e)
- This builds automatic recognition
- Within 2-3 days, orientation becomes natural

---

### Problem: Can't Read Rhythm Notation with Metronome

**Symptoms:**
- Missing beats
- Can't stay with metronome
- Rhythm feels choppy or rushed

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Tempo is too fast**
- Drop to 40 BPM (yes, that slow!)
- Build accuracy first, speed second
- Don't increase until you can play 5 times perfectly

**Solution 2: Count out loud**
- Say "1, 2, 3, 4" as you play
- Or "1-and-2-and-3-and-4-and" for eighth notes
- Vocalization helps internalize rhythm

**Solution 3: Subdivide the beat**
- Set metronome to 80 BPM
- Count eighth notes (1-and-2-and...)
- This makes quarter notes easier to hit

**Solution 4: Clap first, play second**
- Clap the rhythm pattern while counting
- Once rhythm is internalized in your body
- Then transfer to guitar
- Separates rhythm from technique challenges

---

### Problem: Can't Find Good TAB Online

**Symptoms:**
- TAB looks wrong or sounds bad
- Multiple versions with different fingerings
- Unsure which version is accurate

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Check ratings**
- Ultimate Guitar has star ratings
- Choose highest-rated versions (4+ stars)
- Read comments for accuracy feedback

**Solution 2: Compare to original**
- Listen to original recording while reading TAB
- Does it match?
- If not, try different version

**Solution 3: Use professional sites**
- Songsterr typically has accurate transcriptions
- JustinGuitar provides verified TAB
- These cost nothing or very little

**Solution 4: Trust your ear**
- If something sounds wrong, it probably is
- Feel free to modify TAB to match recording
- Write your own correction

---

### Problem: Chord Diagrams Don't Match What I Know

**Symptoms:**
- Diagram shows different fingering than you learned
- Shape looks weird or difficult
- Unsure which version to use

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Multiple correct fingerings exist**
- Same shape, different finger assignments
- Both can be "correct"
- Use whichever is easier for YOU

**Solution 2: Context matters**
- Diagram might show advanced voicing
- Or alternate position on fretboard
- If it sounds right and you can play it, it's valid

**Solution 3: Start with basic open shapes**
- For beginners, stick with open chord shapes (Lessons 1-8)
- Ignore barre chord diagrams for now
- Build complexity gradually

---

### Problem: Reading is Too Slow

**Symptoms:**
- Takes forever to figure out a song
- Have to stop and start constantly
- Feel frustrated by slow progress

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: This is normal for beginners!**
- Reading fluency takes months, not days
- Even after this lesson, expect slow reading at first
- It WILL speed up with practice

**Solution 2: Start with songs you know**
- Learn songs you can already hum/sing
- Reading becomes confirming, not decoding
- Builds confidence

**Solution 3: Choose appropriate difficulty**
- Start with two-chord shapes songs
- Avoid complex TAB with advanced techniques
- Build gradually to harder material

**Solution 4: Practice sight-reading daily**
- Spend 5-10 minutes reading NEW TAB every day
- Doesn't have to be a complete song
- Small, regular exposure builds fluency fastest

**Solution 5: Remember slow practice principle**
- Reading at 40 BPM is not "too slow" - it's correct!
- Accuracy builds fluency
- Speed follows naturally
- Don't rush the process

---

### Problem: TAB and Recording Don't Match

**Symptoms:**
- Playing what TAB says, but sounds wrong
- Rhythm doesn't line up with song
- Notes seem off

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Check tuning**
- Make sure your guitar is in standard tuning (EADGBE)
- Use tuner app
- Re-tune and try again

**Solution 2: TAB might be wrong**
- Not all online TAB is accurate
- Try a different version
- Trust your ear over internet TAB

**Solution 3: Recording might use different tuning**
- Some songs use alternate tunings (drop D, etc.)
- Check song description for tuning info
- Standard tuning TAB won't work for alternate tunings

**Solution 4: Capo usage**
- Original recording might use capo
- Check if TAB mentions capo
- Add capo at specified fret
- We'll explore capos more in future lessons

### ⏰ NOT READY YET?

**Spend more time on:**

**If TAB is confusing:**
- Do Exercises 1-4 repeatedly (single-note and chord shape TAB)
- Use physical reference (mark strings on your guitar)
- Practice orientation: "High e top, low E bottom"
- Give it 2-3 more days of practice

**If chord diagrams are difficult:**
- Review diagrams for shapes you already know (Em, Am, D, G, C)
- Draw them yourself multiple times
- Compare diagram to your actual hand position
- Build visual-physical connection

**If rhythm notation is challenging:**
- All rhythm exercises at 40 BPM (even slower than specified)
- Count out loud religiously
- Separate rhythm (clap) from technique (play)
- Don't increase tempo until perfect at current speed
- Remember: Slow is smooth, smooth is fast!

**If online resources are overwhelming:**
- Start with just ONE site (Ultimate Guitar recommended)
- Search for songs you already know (easier to confirm accuracy)
- Stick to "Chords" versions (simpler than full TAB)
- Build confidence with familiar material

**If reading is too slow:**
- THIS IS NORMAL! Reading fluency takes months
- Continue lesson even if reading is slow
- Practice reading 5-10 minutes daily
- Speed will come naturally with exposure

### 🧠 REMEMBER

**This lesson introduces a SKILL, not just knowledge.**

**Reading music notation is like learning a new language:**
- Week 1: Learning alphabet (this lesson)
- Month 1: Reading simple sentences (easy songs)
- Month 3: Reading paragraphs (intermediate songs)
- Month 6+: Reading fluently (complex songs)

**You're at Week 1 - be patient with yourself!**

Meeting the success criteria means you:
- ✅ Understand the notation systems
- ✅ Can read simple examples slowly
- ✅ Know where to find resources
- ✅ Can learn songs independently (at slow tempo)
- ✅ Practiced with proper tempo discipline

**Mastery takes months of daily reading practice, not 6 days!**

## 🎯 FINAL THOUGHTS

**You just learned a superpower: Musical literacy!**

**What this means:**
- You can now learn thousands of songs from written notation
- You're no longer dependent on finding perfect video tutorials
- You can document your own musical ideas
- You can communicate with other musicians universally
- You've become a more independent guitarist

**Remember these key points:**
- TAB is a visual map of the fretboard (six lines = six strings)
- Chord diagrams show exact finger placement (dots and numbers)
- Rhythm notation tells you when to play (strokes and beats)
- Lead sheets combine shapes with lyrics (most common format online)
- Online resources (Ultimate Guitar, Songsterr) give you unlimited songs
- Writing your own notation preserves ideas and builds understanding

**But most importantly:**

**Reading fluency is built slowly, with accuracy, using a metronome.**

- Start at 40 BPM (even when it feels painfully slow)
- Build perfect accuracy at that tempo
- Add 5 BPM only when flawless
- Track your progress over weeks and months
- Be patient - this is a long-term skill
- Trust the process: Slow is smooth, smooth is fast

**Every song you learn from notation makes the next one easier!**

**The reading skills you developed today are foundational - they'll serve you for your entire guitar journey.**

**See you in Lesson 10 - Fingerstyle Basics!** 🎸
