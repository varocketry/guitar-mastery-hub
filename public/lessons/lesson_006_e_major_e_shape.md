# Lesson 6: The E-Shape - Major Version (Your Sixth Chord Shape!)

**â±ï¸ TYPICAL COMPLETION TIME**: 5-7 days  
**ðŸ“… PRACTICE SESSION LENGTH**: 30-45 minutes per session  
**ðŸ“ **PHASE**: Foundation (Lessons 1-30)  
**ðŸŽ¯ PREREQUISITES**: Lessons 1-5 complete (Em, Am, D, G, C **chord shapes** + strumming patterns mastered)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ COMPLETING THE MOST IMPORTANT SHAPE FAMILY

**Remember Lesson 1?**

**The very first chord shape you learned was Em** (E minor).

Two fingers. Middle strings. Simple. The beginning of your guitar journey.

**That was the MINOR version of the E-shape.**

**Today, you're learning the MAJOR version - E major.**

**And this is huge.**

---

### Why E Major is Special

**The E-shape family is THE most important shape pattern in all of guitar.**

**Not just "important."**

**THE MOST IMPORTANT.**

**Why?**

Because the E-shape is:
- The foundation of barre chords (Lessons 21-24)
- Movable across the entire fretboard
- Used in literally thousands of songs
- The shape that unlocks complete fretboard access

**Every professional guitarist masters the E-shape.**

**Today, you join them.**

---

### The Shape You Already Know

**Em shape (from Lesson 1):**
```
e|---
B|---
G|---
D|--2 â† Middle finger
A|--2 â† Ring finger
E|--0 â† Open
```
- Two fingers
- Minor (sad) sound
- Your first shape ever

**Today you're adding ONE more finger to complete the MAJOR version:**
```
e|---
B|---
G|--1 â† NEW! Index finger makes it MAJOR
D|--2 â† Middle finger (same position!)
A|--2 â† Ring finger (same position!)
E|--0 â† Open
```
- Three fingers (one more!)
- Major (bright) sound
- Complete E-shape family!

**You're not learning something completely new.**

**You're UPGRADING something you already know.**

---

### From Minor to Major: One Finger Changes Everything

**This is the magic of shape families:**

**Em shape** (2 fingers) â†’ **E major shape** (3 fingers)  
**Same base pattern + one finger = emotional transformation**

**Minor**: Sad, introspective, melancholy  
**Major**: Bright, happy, powerful

**One finger. Complete emotional change.**

**This is the power of understanding SHAPES instead of memorizing isolated chords.**

---

### Why This Matters for Your Future

**Lesson 4 taught you:** These shapes are movable patterns.

**Today you prove it** with the E-shape:

**E major shape** (open position, today):
- Played at nut (frets 0-1-2)
- Creates E major chord
- Open strings ring

**F major shape** (barre chord, Lesson 21):
- Move E major shape up 1 fret
- Add barre with index across all strings
- Creates F major chord
- **SAME SHAPE, DIFFERENT LOCATION!**

**G major shape** (barre chord, Lesson 21):
- Move E major shape up 3 frets
- Add barre
- Creates G major chord
- **SAME SHAPE, DIFFERENT LOCATION!**

**One shape = infinite chords.**

**Today you master the OPEN version at proper tempo.**  
**In Lesson 21, you make it MOVABLE.**

---

### Bonus: A Major Shape Too!

**Since you're learning shape families, we're including A major shape today:**

**Why bundle these two?**
- Both are MAJOR versions of shapes you know (Em â†’ E major, Am â†’ A major)
- Both complete essential shape families
- Both are required for common songs
- Learning them together reinforces the MAJOR vs MINOR concept

**By end of today:**
- âœ… Seven total shapes (Em, Am, D, G, C, **E major, A major**)
- âœ… Two complete shape families (E-shape: Em + E major, A-shape: Am + A major)
- âœ… Ready for any beginner/intermediate song

**This is critical mass Ã— 2.**

---

### The Songs This Unlocks

**With E major and A major added:**

**"Stand By Me"** - Ben E. King
- Uses: A, E, D shapes
- You can now play it!

**"Twist and Shout"** - The Beatles  
- Uses: D, G, A, E shapes
- You can now play it!

**"Wild Thing"** - The Troggs
- Uses: A, D, E shapes
- You can now play it!

**"La Bamba"** - Ritchie Valens
- Uses: C, G, D shapes  
- You could already play this, but NOW you can add E and A variations!

**You're not just adding shapes. You're adding SONGS.**

---

### What Makes This Lesson Different

**Lessons 1-3**: Learned five foundation shapes one at a time  
**Lesson 4**: Understood they're MOVABLE patterns  
**Lesson 5**: Applied RHYTHM to shapes

**Lesson 6** (today): Complete shape FAMILIES
- Em + E major = E-shape family complete
- Am + A major = A-shape family complete
- Understand MAJOR vs MINOR transformations
- Preview how these become barre chords

**You're not just learning. You're UNDERSTANDING.**

---

### The Practice Approach

**Both shapes today, but NOT rushed:**

**Days 1-3**: Focus entirely on E major shape at 40-50 BPM
- Form it cleanly
- Switch to/from other shapes
- Apply strumming patterns

**Days 4-6**: Add A major shape at 40-50 BPM  
- Form it cleanly
- Switch to/from other shapes
- Apply strumming patterns

**Day 7**: Integrate both new shapes at 60 BPM
- Play songs using all seven shapes
- Celebrate completion!

**Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast. Two shapes in 7 days = CORRECT tempo.**

---

### The Promise

**By the end of this lesson:**

âœ… You'll complete two essential shape families  
âœ… You'll understand MAJOR/MINOR transformations  
âœ… You'll play songs using all seven shapes  
âœ… You'll see how shapes become barre chords  
âœ… You'll have the foundation 90% of guitarists have

**You'll cross from "good beginner" to "solid foundation."**

**Let's complete these shape families.** ðŸŽ¸

---

## ðŸŽ“ LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Form the E major **chord shape** cleanly with all three fingers
- Understand the E-shape family (Em shape vs. E major shape)
- Switch smoothly between E major shape and other shapes you know at 60 BPM
- Recognize the E-shape as a **movable pattern** (barre chord preview!)
- Apply the E major shape to complete songs
- Form the A major **chord shape** (bonus shape for this lesson)
- Understand how both E and A shapes relate to the **movable shape** concept

---

## ðŸŽ¯ REMEMBERING THE SHAPE PHILOSOPHY

**As Den Lopez teaches:** "Learn shapes, not chords."

### What You've Learned So Far

**Your Five Foundation Shapes** (from Lessons 1-4):
- **Em shape** - Two-finger minor pattern (Lesson 1)
- **Am shape** - Three-finger minor pattern (Lesson 1)
- **D shape** - Three-finger triangle pattern (Lesson 2)
- **G shape** - Wide three-finger spread pattern (Lesson 3)
- **C shape** - Three-finger diagonal pattern (Lesson 3)

**Lesson 4 Revelation:** These aren't random chord fingerings - they're SHAPE PATTERNS!

**Lesson 5 Application:** You learned to apply strumming patterns to ALL your shapes.

### Today: Completing the E-Shape Family

**You already know Em shape** (Lesson 1):
- Minor version = sad, moody sound
- Two fingers on 2nd fret

**Today you learn E major shape**:
- Major version = bright, happy sound  
- THREE fingers (one more than Em!)
- **SAME basic shape pattern** with one finger addition

**Why this matters:**
The E-shape is THE most important movable shape in guitar. Master it open (today), and you'll unlock barre chords in Lessons 21-24!

---

## ðŸŽ¯ FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLE: Slow is Smooth, Smooth is Fast

### Learning New Chord Shapes = SLOWER Than You Think!

**When adding E major and A major shapes to your vocabulary, you're NOT just learning two new finger positions - you're building entirely new neural pathways and expanding your shape pattern library!**

### **Slow shape formation = Fast shape mastery**
### **Fast attempts = Slow progress (and frustration)**

---

### What This Means for This Lesson

**Starting Tempo for Shape Formation:** 40 BPM (very slow - feels like slow motion!)  
**Target Tempo for Shape Transitions:** 60 BPM (by end of lesson)  
**Song Tempo by End:** 80-100 BPM (simplified versions)

**Why these specific tempos?**
- 40 BPM = Your brain has TIME to:
  - See where fingers should go (visualize the shape)
  - Move fingers to correct position
  - Place fingers with proper technique
  - Check for clean sound
  - Build accurate motor pattern

- 60 BPM = Shape transitions become more automatic
- 80-100 BPM = Can play along with songs

---

### Why This Works: The Science

**Your brain learns what you practice:**
- Practice forming shapes sloppily at fast tempo = Learn sloppy shapes permanently
- Practice forming shapes perfectly at slow tempo = Learn perfect shapes permanently

**New Chord Shape Formation Takes 4-7 Days:**
- Days 1-2: Fingers find positions (40 BPM)
- Days 3-4: Muscle memory forming (45 BPM)
- Days 5-7: Becoming automatic (50-60 BPM)

**Speed is a BYPRODUCT of accuracy, not a goal in itself.**

---

### The Metronome is Your Best Friend

**Every exercise in this lesson includes starting tempos.**

**The metronome is NOT OPTIONAL.**

You're learning TWO new chord shapes (E major and A major). Without a metronome, you will:
- Rush through shape formation (fingers land in wrong spots)
- Practice mistakes (building bad habits)
- Feel frustrated (why aren't shapes getting better?)

**Solution:** Set metronome, practice at specified tempo, build correctly from day 1.

**Apps:** Metronome Beats (free), Pro Metronome, Soundbrenner

---

### Tempo Progression for This Lesson

**Week 1: Shape Formation**
```
Days 1-2: 40 BPM (shape formation on beat 1, strum on beat 2)
Days 3-4: 45 BPM (building muscle memory)
Days 5-6: 50 BPM (transitions starting)
Day 7: 55-60 BPM (approaching target)
```

**Week 2 (if needed): Shape Transitions**
```
Days 8-10: 60 BPM (clean transitions)
Days 11-14: 70-80 BPM (song tempo approaching)
```

**CRITICAL RULE:** If you make more than 2 mistakes at new tempo, drop back 5 BPM and practice there for 2 more days!

---

### "But 40 BPM is TOO SLOW!" - NO IT'S NOT

**If slow shape formation feels boring, you're at the RIGHT tempo for learning.**

**Real talk:**
- Every professional guitarist practiced chord shapes slowly
- Your favorite guitarist spent WEEKS on basic shapes
- Jimi Hendrix practiced shape transitions at slow tempos
- Eddie Van Halen built speed through slow, perfect practice

**If it's good enough for them, it's good enough for you.**

**Speed comes from perfect slow practice. There are no shortcuts.**

The difference between good guitarists and great guitarists:
- Good: Practice at medium tempo, get medium results
- Great: Practice perfectly at slow tempo, speed develops naturally

## ðŸ“– THEORY: The E-Shape Family & Why It's Special

### Understanding the Shape Philosophy (Den Lopez Core Teaching)

**Den Lopez's Revolutionary Insight:**

"Guitarists don't learn 50 different chords. They learn 5-6 **SHAPES** and move them around the fretboard."

**What's a shape?**
- A physical finger pattern (not just a chord name)
- A pattern that can MOVE to different frets
- A family of related sounds (major, minor, variations)

**The E-Shape is the KING of movable shapes!**

Why?
1. **Easy to see** - Fingers on the low strings, easy to watch
2. **Easy to move** - Natural hand position for barring
3. **Strong sound** - Uses all 6 strings
4. **Most commonly used** - More songs use E-shape barre chords than any other
5. **Foundation for lead** - Many solos use E-shape positions

### The E-Shape Family Members

**Member #1: Em Shape** (You learned in Lesson 1)
```
E minor shape - "The dark cousin"
    E A D G B e
    0 2 2 0 0 0
    
Finger pattern:
- Middle finger: A string, 2nd fret
- Ring finger: D string, 2nd fret
- All other strings: Open

Sound: Dark, moody, contemplative
Used in: Minor key songs, sad ballads, folk music
```

**Member #2: E Major Shape** (Today's star!)
```
E major shape - "The bright leader"
    E A D G B e
    0 2 2 1 0 0
    
Finger pattern:
- Index finger: G string, 1st fret
- Middle finger: A string, 2nd fret
- Ring finger: D string, 2nd fret
- All other strings: Open

Sound: Bright, happy, powerful
Used in: Major key songs, rock anthems, pop hits
```

**Notice the difference?**
- **ONLY ONE FINGER CHANGES!**
- Em shape: G string is open (0)
- E major shape: G string has finger on 1st fret
- That one finger changes it from minor (sad) to major (happy)

**This is the power of shape thinking:**
- You don't learn "two different chords"
- You learn "one SHAPE with two versions"
- Major â†” Minor = ONE finger difference
- This pattern repeats across ALL shape families!

---

### Why the E-Shape is "Movable" (Preview of Barre Chords)

**Here's where it gets REALLY exciting:**

The E-shape can **move up the neck** to create different chords!

```
Position         Result          Type
â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•
Open (fret 0)    E major         Open chord (today!)
Fret 1           F major         Barre chord
Fret 3           G major         Barre chord  
Fret 5           A major         Barre chord
Fret 7           B major         Barre chord
Fret 8           C major         Barre chord
```

**How does it move?**
- Add your index finger as a "movable capo" (called a barre)
- Keep the same shape with other fingers
- Move the whole pattern up the fretboard
- Different positions = different chords!

**Don't worry about barre chords yet** - we'll tackle those in Lessons 21-24. But understanding that this SHAPE MOVES is the key insight!

---

### The A-Shape Family (Bonus Shape Today!)

**Today you also learn A major shape** - another movable shape that works with E-shape!

```
A major shape:
    E A D G B e
    X 0 2 2 2 0
    
Don't play low E string
All other strings play
```

**Why learn A major today?**
1. Works perfectly with E major in songs
2. Another movable shape (like E-shape)
3. Completes your "Major Shapes" foundation
4. Used in thousands of popular songs

**The Pattern:**
- You already know **Am shape** (Lesson 1) - minor version
- Today you learn **A major shape** - major version
- Again: ONE finger difference between major and minor!

---

### Den Lopez's "Shapes Not Chords" Philosophy in Action

**Traditional Teaching (OLD WAY):**
```
"Learn E chord. Now learn F chord. Now learn G chord..."
(Student thinks: "How will I ever remember 50 different fingerings?!")
```

**Shape Philosophy (DEN LOPEZ WAY):**
```
"Learn E-shape. Now MOVE it to fret 1 (F). Now MOVE it to fret 3 (G)..."
(Student thinks: "Oh! It's ONE shape I can move around!")
```

**Which sounds easier?**

**The mental shift:**
- NOT: "I need to memorize 100 chord positions"
- YES: "I need to learn 5-6 shapes and move them"

**This is how professionals think!**

---

## ðŸŽ¸ YOUR SIXTH CHORD SHAPE: E Major

### E Major Chord Shape Diagram

![E Major Chord](/chord_diagrams/chord_e_L006_01.svg)

**Finger Placement:**
- Index finger (1): G string, 1st fret
- Middle finger (2): A string, 2nd fret
- Ring finger (3): D string, 2nd fret
- Strings E, B, and e: Play open (no fingers)

**Result:** E - B - E - G# - B - E (notes)

**Shape Characteristics:**
- **Finger span:** 2 frets (1st to 2nd fret)
- **Strings used:** All 6 strings
- **Difficulty:** Medium (3 fingers, small stretch)
- **Shape family:** E-shape (major version)
- **Movability:** Highly movable (becomes barre chord with index finger bar)

---

### Comparing to Em Shape (What Changed?)

**Em shape** (from Lesson 1):
```
    E A D G B e
    0 2 2 0 0 0
    
Two fingers only:
- Middle finger: A string, 2nd fret
- Ring finger: D string, 2nd fret
```

**E major shape** (today):
```
    E A D G B e
    0 2 2 1 0 0
    
Three fingers now:
- Index finger: G string, 1st fret  â† NEW ADDITION!
- Middle finger: A string, 2nd fret â† Same as Em
- Ring finger: D string, 2nd fret  â† Same as Em
```

**The Addition:**
- ONE finger added (index on G string, 1st fret)
- Changes note: G (open) â†’ G# (1st fret)
- Changes sound: Minor â†’ Major
- Changes feel: Sad â†’ Happy

**This is shape thinking:**
- Not two different "chords"
- One SHAPE with one finger modification
- Minor â†” Major conversion is simple!

---

### Visual Shape Recognition (Den Lopez Method)

**The E-Shape Pattern** (what your hand "sees"):

```
Visual Pattern:

    â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”
    â”‚   [1]       â”‚  â† Index finger (1st fret)
    â”‚ [2]         â”‚  â† Middle & Ring together (2nd fret)
    â”‚   [3]       â”‚
    â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”˜

Look at your hand forming E major:
- Index finger reaches "forward" (toward nut)
- Middle and ring form a "wall" on 2nd fret
- Creates a small "staircase" pattern
```

**This visual pattern is THE E-SHAPE!**

When you move this shape up the neck (barre chords), your hand recognizes this SAME visual pattern.

**Shape recognition is faster than note memorization!**

---

## ðŸŽ¸ STEP-BY-STEP: FORMING E MAJOR SHAPE

### Stage 1: Understanding Finger Positions (No Tempo - 5 minutes)

**Before we add metronome, let's understand the shape:**

**The Building Block Approach:**

**Step 1: Start with What You Know (Em Shape)**
1. Form your Em shape (middle and ring finger on 2nd fret)
2. You already know this - you've practiced it for days!
3. Strum once - hear that Em sound
4. This is your foundation

**Step 2: Add the "Major Maker" (Index Finger)**
1. Keep middle and ring fingers exactly where they are
2. Bring your index finger to G string, 1st fret
3. Your index finger "reaches over" toward the nut
4. Don't press hard yet - just place it

**Step 3: The Complete E Major Shape**
1. Now you have all three fingers down:
   - Index: G string, 1st fret (the "major maker")
   - Middle: A string, 2nd fret (from Em)
   - Ring: D string, 2nd fret (from Em)
2. Arch your fingers - all on fingertips
3. Make sure index finger isn't touching the B string!

**Checkpoint Question:**
Can you see how this is just **Em shape + one finger**?
- Yes â†’ Great! You're thinking in shapes!
- Not yet â†’ Review the comparison diagrams above

---

### Stage 2: Timed Shape Formation (40 BPM - Days 1-2)

**NOW we add the metronome!**

**Set metronome to 40 BPM (very slow!)**

**CRITICAL: One beat per action, not one beat for entire shape!**

```
Formation Sequence (4 beats total):

Beat 1: Place middle finger (A string, 2nd fret)
Beat 2: Add ring finger (D string, 2nd fret)
        [Now you have Em shape]
Beat 3: Add index finger (G string, 1st fret)
        [Now you have E major shape]
Beat 4: Strum and listen
```

**Practice Routine:**
1. Set metronome to 40 BPM
2. Count out loud: "1 - 2 - 3 - 4"
3. On beat 1: Middle finger down
4. On beat 2: Ring finger down  
5. On beat 3: Index finger down
6. On beat 4: Strum all 6 strings and LISTEN

**Do this 20 times** (about 5 minutes)

**What to listen for:**
- All 6 strings should ring clearly
- No buzzing (especially B and high e strings)
- Bright, full sound
- All fingers firm on strings

**Goal:** Every finger lands cleanly at its assigned beat. All strings ring clearly on beat 4.

---

### Stage 3: Faster Formation (45 BPM - Days 3-4)

**Increase metronome to 45 BPM**

Now use 2 beats instead of 4:

```
Beat 1: Place all three fingers (middle, ring, index together)
Beat 2: Strum and listen
```

**Why this is faster:**
- Your fingers are learning to move as a UNIT
- The shape is becoming automatic
- Brain is storing the pattern as "E major shape"

**Practice Routine:**
1. Set metronome to 45 BPM
2. Count: "1 - 2, 1 - 2, 1 - 2"
3. On beat 1: All fingers land together (as one shape)
4. On beat 2: Strum and check sound quality
5. Lift fingers, shake hand
6. Repeat on next beat 1

**Do this 30 times** (about 7 minutes)

**Checkpoint:** Can you form E major shape on beat 1 and have it sound clean on beat 2?
- Yes â†’ Move to Stage 4!
- No â†’ Stay at 40 BPM for 2 more days (this is normal!)

---

### Stage 4: Comfortable Formation (50 BPM - Days 5-6)

**Increase metronome to 50 BPM**

Same 2-beat pattern, but slightly faster:

```
Beat 1: Form complete E major shape
Beat 2: Strum
```

**Now add these checks:**

**Visual Check (every 5th rep):**
- Are all fingers on fingertips?
- Is index finger close to 1st fret wire?
- Are middle and ring fingers close to 2nd fret wire?
- Is there space between fingers (not bunched)?

**Audio Check (every rep):**
- Pluck each string individually instead of strumming
- Listen: D, G, B, and e strings - do they ring clearly?
- If any string buzzes, adjust that finger

**Practice Routine:**
1. Set metronome to 50 BPM
2. 40 repetitions total:
   - 35 reps: Form on 1, strum on 2
   - 5 reps: Form on 1, pluck each string individually on 2-3-4-5

**Goal:** The E major shape is starting to feel natural. Your fingers "know" where to go.

---

### Stage 5: Automatic Formation (55-60 BPM - Day 7)

**Increase metronome to 55-60 BPM**

**At this stage:**
- Your fingers should move to position automatically
- You shouldn't have to think about each finger placement
- The shape feels like "one motion" not "three finger placements"

**Practice Routine:**
1. Set metronome to 55 BPM
2. 50 repetitions:
   - Form E major shape on beat 1
   - Strum on beat 2
3. Don't look at your fingers for last 10 reps:
   - Look at the headstock or ceiling
   - Your fingers should find positions by feel
4. If successful, increase to 60 BPM for final 10 reps

**Checkpoint:**
- Can you form E major shape without looking? âœ“
- Does it sound clean every time? âœ“
- Are you ready for shape transitions? âœ“

**If yes to all three â†’ You've mastered E major shape formation!**

---

## ðŸ”„ PRACTICE ROUTINE: E Major Shape Exercises

### Exercise 1: "The Shape Builder" (5 minutes, 40 BPM)

**Purpose:** Reinforce the "Em + one finger = E major" concept

```
Set metronome: 40 BPM

Sequence:
Beat 1-4: Form Em shape, strum, listen
Beat 5: Add index finger (now it's E major)
Beat 6: Strum, hear the major sound
Beat 7-8: Remove index finger (back to Em), strum

Repeat 10 times
```

**What you're learning:**
- The relationship between Em and E major shapes
- How ONE finger changes minor â†’ major
- Shape family thinking (not isolated fingerings)

---

### Exercise 2: "The Clear Ring Test" (5 minutes, no tempo)

**Purpose:** Ensure every string rings clearly

```
No metronome needed

Process:
1. Form E major shape
2. Don't strum - pluck each string individually:
   - Low E string: Does it ring clearly? (open string)
   - A string: Clear ring? (middle finger, 2nd fret)
   - D string: Clear ring? (ring finger, 2nd fret)
   - G string: Clear ring? (index finger, 1st fret)
   - B string: Clear ring? (open string)
   - High e string: Clear ring? (open string)
3. Any buzzing? Adjust that finger:
   - Move closer to fret wire
   - Press harder
   - Check finger angle (on tip?)
4. Once all 6 strings ring clearly, you've got it!

Repeat until every string rings on first try (usually 10-15 attempts)
```

---

### Exercise 3: "The Shape Hold" (5 minutes, no tempo)

**Purpose:** Build finger strength and endurance

```
No metronome needed

Process:
1. Form E major shape correctly
2. Hold it for 30 seconds without strumming
3. Don't release pressure
4. Keep all fingers in position
5. After 30 seconds, release and shake out hand
6. Rest for 15 seconds
7. Repeat 6 times

Goal: Build stamina. E major uses three fingers, so your hand needs strength.
```

**Note:** This may hurt! Finger fatigue is normal. If fingers start cramping, reduce hold time to 20 seconds and take longer rest breaks.

---

### Exercise 4: "The Quick Shape Formation" (4 minutes, no tempo)

**Purpose:** Build speed of shape formation

```
No metronome needed (you'll time yourself)

Process:
1. Start with fingers off guitar
2. On "go," form E major shape as quickly as possible
3. Time yourself: How many seconds?
4. Release fingers
5. Repeat 20 times
6. Try to get faster each time

Targets:
Day 1: 3-5 seconds (normal for first day)
Day 3: 2-3 seconds
Day 7: 1-2 seconds
Eventually: Under 1 second (instant!)

### Exercise 5: "E Major Shape + Strumming Patterns" (10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Apply strumming patterns (from Lesson 5) to E major shape

**Set metronome to 60 BPM**

**Pattern #1: Basic Down-Up** (from Lesson 5)
```
E major shape
| D  U  D  U | D  U  D  U |
  1  &  2  &   3  &  4  &

Hold E major shape for entire measure
Strum pattern: Down, up, down, up, down, up, down, up

Practice 20 times
```

**Pattern #2: Folk/Country** (from Lesson 5)
```
E major shape
| D    D-U    U-D-U |
  1    2  &    &3&4&

Hold E major shape for entire measure
Strum pattern: Down, (pause), Down-up, (pause), up-down-up

Practice 15 times
```

**Goal:** E major shape stays solid while your strumming hand moves. Shape formation is now separate from strumming motion.

## ðŸŽ¸ YOUR SEVENTH CHORD SHAPE: A Major (Bonus!)

### Why Learn A Major Today?

**Two reasons:**

**1. Musical Completeness**
- E major and A major are "best friends" in music
- They appear together in thousands of songs
- Learning them together makes musical sense

**2. Shape Philosophy**
- You already know **Am shape** (Lesson 1)
- Today you learn **A major shape**
- Another example of "shape + one finger change = major/minor"

### A Major Chord Shape Diagram

![A Major Chord](/chord_diagrams/chord_a_L006_02.svg)

**Finger Placement (Two Methods):**

**METHOD 1 (Recommended for beginners):**
- Index finger (1): D string, 2nd fret
- Middle finger (2): G string, 2nd fret  
- Ring finger (3): B string, 2nd fret
- All three fingers on 2nd fret in a row!

**METHOD 2 (Alternative - easier for some):**
- Middle finger (2): D string, 2nd fret
- Index, middle, ring (1-3-4): G, B, e strings, 2nd fret
  [All three fingers squeezed together]

**Result:** A - E - A - C# - E (notes)

### Step-by-Step: Forming A Major Shape (QUICK VERSION)

**Set metronome to 40 BPM**

**The Three-Finger Stack (Method 1):**

```
Beat 1: Index finger on D string, 2nd fret
Beat 2: Middle finger on G string, 2nd fret (right next to index)
Beat 3: Ring finger on B string, 2nd fret (right next to middle)
Beat 4: Strum from A string down (5 strings)
```

**Do this 20 times**

**Visual tip:** Your three fingers form a little "wall" across the 2nd fret on three adjacent strings.

---

### Practice Routine: A Major Shape (15 minutes total)

**Exercise 1: Formation Practice** (5 minutes, 40 BPM)
```
Set metronome: 40 BPM

Formation sequence (4 beats):
Beat 1: Index down (D string, 2nd fret)
Beat 2: Middle down (G string, 2nd fret)
Beat 3: Ring down (B string, 2nd fret)
Beat 4: Strum (A string down, skip low E)

Repeat 25 times
```

**Exercise 2: Clear Ring Check** (5 minutes, no tempo)
```
No metronome

1. Form A major shape
2. Pluck each string (A, D, G, B, e only)
3. All five should ring clearly
4. If buzzing, adjust fingers:
   - Are you on fingertips?
   - Close to fret wire?
   - Pressing hard enough?
5. Repeat until all strings clear

Do 10 complete checks
```

**Exercise 3: Compare Am to A Major** (5 minutes, no tempo)
```
No metronome

Compare the shapes:

Am shape (Lesson 1):    A major shape (today):
X 0 2 2 1 0             X 0 2 2 2 0
                              â†‘
                        Only difference!

Process:
1. Form Am shape, strum, listen (minor sound)
2. Move ring finger from 1st fret to 2nd fret (now A major)
3. Strum, listen (major sound)
4. Switch back and forth 15 times
5. ONE FINGER changes minor â†’ major!

This is shape thinking!
```

## ðŸ”„ SHAPE TRANSITIONS: Combining E and A with Your Other Shapes

### Transition Practice Overview

**You now have SEVEN chord shapes:**
1. Em shape
2. Am shape  
3. D shape
4. G shape
5. C shape
6. **E major shape** (new today!)
7. **A major shape** (new today!)

**Goal:** Be able to switch between E major shape and any other shape at 60 BPM.

---

### Transition Exercise 1: Em â†” E Major (5 minutes, 50 BPM)

**Set metronome to 50 BPM**

**This is the EASIEST transition** (only one finger moves!)

```
Pattern (8 beats total):
Em shape:      | 1  2  3  4 |
E major shape: | 1  2  3  4 |

Process:
1. Form Em shape (middle and ring on 2nd fret)
2. Hold for 4 beats, strum each beat
3. Add index finger on G string, 1st fret (now E major)
4. Hold for 4 beats, strum each beat
5. Remove index finger (back to Em)
6. Repeat 20 times

Goal: Smooth transition, no pauses between shapes
```

**What you're learning:**
- The Em/E major shape relationship
- How to add/remove just ONE finger
- Shape family thinking

---

### Transition Exercise 2: E Major â†” A Major (8 minutes, 45 BPM)

**Set metronome to 45 BPM**

**These two shapes appear together ALL THE TIME in songs!**

```
Pattern (8 beats total):
E major shape: | 1  2  3  4 |
A major shape: | 1  2  3  4 |

Process:
1. Form E major shape
2. Strum 4 times (one strum per beat)
3. Lift all fingers
4. Form A major shape (three fingers on 2nd fret)
5. Strum 4 times (remember: start strum on A string, skip low E!)
6. Lift all fingers
7. Back to E major shape
8. Repeat 20 times

Goal: Clean transition within 1-2 seconds
```

**Practice Strategy:**
- Days 1-2: Take your time, accuracy over speed
- Days 3-4: Start building fluidity
- Days 5-7: Increase tempo to 50-55 BPM

---

### Transition Exercise 3: The Shape Circle (10 minutes, 50 BPM)

**Set metronome to 50 BPM**

**Purpose:** Practice E major and A major in context with all your shapes

```
The Full Shape Circle:

Em | Am | D | G | C | E major | A major | Em |
 4 beats each shape

That's 28 beats total for one complete cycle

Process:
1. Start with Em shape, strum 4 times
2. Switch to Am shape, strum 4 times
3. Continue through all seven shapes
4. When you get back to Em, you've completed one cycle
5. How long did it take?
6. Goal: Complete 3 cycles in a row with no mistakes

Tempo progression:
Day 1-2: 45 BPM (slow and careful)
Day 3-5: 50 BPM (building fluidity)
Day 6-7: 55-60 BPM (approaching song tempo)
```

**This exercise:**
- Puts E major and A major shapes in context
- Builds stamina (28 beats is a long sequence!)
- Develops mental tracking (remembering which shape comes next)
- Prepares you for real songs

---

### Transition Tips: Making Switches Smoother

**Tip 1: Anticipate the Next Shape**
- While playing E major, your brain should already be thinking "A major next"
- Visualize where your fingers will go
- Mental preparation speeds physical transition

**Tip 2: Minimize Finger Movement**
- Don't lift fingers 3 inches off the fretboard
- Keep fingers hovering 1-2mm above strings
- Smaller movements = faster transitions

**Tip 3: Move All Fingers Together**
- Don't move one finger at a time (index, then middle, then ring)
- Lift all three together, move together, land together
- The SHAPE moves as a unit

**Tip 4: Use "Anchor Fingers" When Possible**
- Em â†’ E major: Middle and ring fingers stay (only index moves!)
- This is much easier than moving all three fingers
- Look for these opportunities

**Tip 5: Practice "Air Shapes"**
- Form E major shape in the air (no guitar)
- Switch to A major shape in the air
- Your hands learn the motion without worrying about sound
- 2 minutes daily of "air practice" builds speed

### â° NOT READY YET?

**That's completely fine!** Most learners spend 5-7 days on this lesson. Here's what to focus on:

#### If E Major Shape Formation is Difficult:
- **Problem:** Fingers hurt or won't form shape
  - **Solution:** Practice "Shape Builder" exercise (Em + one finger)
  - **Time:** 5 minutes daily until automatic
  
- **Problem:** Index finger touches B string (mutes it)
  - **Solution:** Arch index finger more, come down steeper angle
  - **Time:** Check this EVERY rep for 2-3 days

- **Problem:** Takes too long to form (5+ seconds)
  - **Solution:** Stay at 40 BPM for 3 more days
  - **Remember:** Speed comes from perfect slow practice

#### If A Major Shape Formation is Difficult:
- **Problem:** Three fingers won't fit on 2nd fret
  - **Solution:** Try Method 2 (stacked fingers)
  - **OR:** Practice finger spreading exercises daily
  
- **Problem:** Keep hitting low E string
  - **Solution:** Thumb mute technique (rest thumb on low E)
  - **Practice:** Visual targeting (look at A string before strumming)

#### If Shape Transitions are Slow:
- **Problem:** Takes 4-5 seconds to switch
  - **Solution:** This is NORMAL! Keep practicing
  - **Remember:** Day 1 = 5 seconds, Day 7 = 2 seconds, Day 14 = instant
  
- **Problem:** Lose rhythm when switching
  - **Solution:** Slow down tempo! Drop to 50 BPM
  - **Remember:** Accuracy before speed

- **Problem:** Forget which shape comes next
  - **Solution:** Write out shape sequence, practice reading it
  - **Time:** Mental practice (no guitar) helps too!

#### If Songs are Overwhelming:
- **Problem:** Can't keep up with song tempo
  - **Solution:** Songs are PRACTICE GOALS, not day 1 requirements
  - **Timeline:** Week 1 = just shape changes, Week 2 = add rhythm, Week 3 = song tempo

- **Problem:** Too many shape changes too fast
  - **Solution:** Practice just 4 measures repeatedly
  - **Then:** Add next 4 measures
  - **Then:** Combine into full song

---

### ðŸ’¡ REMEMBER

**Most learners spend 5-7 days on this lesson.**

**Why it takes time:**
- Learning TWO new chord shapes (E major and A major)
- Integrating seven total shapes (your full vocabulary now!)
- Applying new shapes to songs
- Building shape transition speed

**Taking your time here = Solid foundation forever!**

Your fingers need time to:
- Build muscle memory for new shapes
- Strengthen for three-finger shapes
- Develop transition speed
- Make shapes automatic

**There's no prize for rushing. Quality beats speed every time.**

---

## ðŸ”§ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: Buzzing Strings on E Major Shape

**Symptoms:**
- Some strings sound muted or buzzy instead of clear
- Especially B and high e strings (the open ones)
- Shape sounds "dead" or incomplete

**Common Causes & Solutions:**

#### Cause 1: Fingers Touching Adjacent Strings
**Diagnosis:**
- Index finger might be touching B string
- This mutes the open B string (very common!)

**Solutions:**
âœ… **Arch index finger more**
- Come down on string at steeper angle
- Fingertip only touching, not side of finger
- Practice: Form shape, look at index finger, adjust angle

âœ… **Check finger position**
- Index finger should be perpendicular to fretboard
- Not angled or laying flat

**Practice Fix:**
```
Exercise: Isolated index finger check (3 minutes)
1. Form complete E major shape
2. Pluck B string (should ring openly)
3. If muted, adjust index finger angle
4. Repeat until B string rings every time
```

---

#### Cause 2: Not Pressing Hard Enough
**Diagnosis:**
- One or more fretted strings sound muted
- Especially D, A, or G strings

**Solutions:**
âœ… **Press firmer with fingertips**
- E major uses 3 fingers = more pressure needed
- Your fingers are building strength (takes time!)

âœ… **Check finger placement relative to fret**
- Fingers should be right next to fret wire (not middle of fret)
- Closer to fret = less pressure needed

âœ… **Build finger strength**
```
Exercise: Shape holds (3 minutes daily)
1. Form E major shape
2. Hold for 20 seconds (don't strum)
3. Keep pressure constant
4. Release, shake hands
5. Repeat 5 times

Builds endurance for maintaining pressure
```

---

#### Cause 3: Thumb Position Wrong
**Diagnosis:**
- Thumb is over top of neck (like hitchhiking)
- OR thumb is too far down neck

**Solutions:**
âœ… **Proper thumb position:**
- Thumb should be on BACK of neck
- Roughly behind middle finger
- Not visible from front when you look at guitar
- Acts as anchor point for finger pressure

âœ… **Check in mirror:**
```
1. Form E major shape
2. Look at neck from side
3. Is thumb visible over top? â†’ Move it to back
4. Is thumb too low on neck? â†’ Move it up behind middle finger
```

---

### Problem: A Major Shape - Fingers Don't Fit

**Symptoms:**
- Three fingers feel cramped on 2nd fret
- Fingers bunching up or touching each other
- Can't get all three down cleanly

**Solutions:**

#### Solution 1: Try Method 2 (Stacked Fingers)
**Instead of:**
```
Index, middle, ring separately placed
â”€â”€â”€1â”€2â”€3â”€â”€â”€â”€  â† Fingers spread across three strings
```

**Try:**
```
All three fingers stacked together
â”€â”€â”€[1+3+4]â”€â”€  â† Fingers bunched together as one unit
```

**How to do it:**
1. Place middle finger on D string, 2nd fret first (anchor)
2. "Stack" index, middle, ring together as one unit
3. All three fingers touching each other
4. Press down together

**This method:**
- Works better for smaller hands
- Uses less lateral finger span
- Feels more secure once you get it

---

#### Solution 2: Finger Stretching Exercises
```
Exercise: Finger spreading (2 minutes, 3x daily)

1. Hold hand up (no guitar)
2. Spread fingers as wide as possible
3. Hold for 10 seconds
4. Relax
5. Repeat 10 times

Do this daily - flexibility improves in 5-7 days!
```

---

#### Solution 3: Start with Two Fingers, Add Third
**Gradual approach:**
```
Day 1-2: Just index and middle fingers (D and G strings)
         Get comfortable with partial shape

Day 3-4: Add ring finger (B string)
         Now complete shape

This builds the shape progressively
```

---

### Problem: Keep Hitting Low E String on A Major

**Symptoms:**
- A major shape sounds "muddy" or wrong
- Including low E string in strum (you shouldn't!)

**Solutions:**

#### Solution 1: Thumb Muting Technique
âœ… **Rest thumb on low E string**
- Lightly touch low E string with side of thumb
- Mutes it even if pick hits it
- Professional technique!

**How to do it:**
```
1. Form A major shape with fretting hand
2. With thumb, lightly rest on low E string
3. Don't press hard - just touch it
4. Now when you strum, low E is automatically muted
```

---

#### Solution 2: Visual Targeting Practice
âœ… **Look where you're strumming**
```
Exercise: Targeted strumming (5 minutes)

Set metronome: 50 BPM

1. Form A major shape
2. LOOK at A string (where strum should start)
3. Strum from A string down (visual guidance)
4. Repeat 30 times
5. After 30 reps, do 10 WITHOUT looking

Goal: Your hand learns where to start strum
```

---

#### Solution 3: Lighter Strumming Motion
**Problem:** Strumming too hard/wide
- Big arm motion hits all strings
- Need smaller, controlled motion

**Solution:**
âœ… Use wrist motion, not arm motion
- Smaller movement = more accurate
- Aim for 4-5 strings only (A, D, G, B, e)
- Power comes from wrist snap, not arm swing

---

### Problem: Shape Transitions Take Too Long (5+ Seconds)

**Symptoms:**
- Long pauses between shapes
- Lose rhythm of songs
- Frustrating gaps in music

**Solutions:**

#### Solution 1: Slow Down Practice Tempo
âœ… **This is NORMAL on Day 1-3!**
- Everyone is slow at first
- Speed comes from repetition
- Be patient with yourself

**Timeline expectations:**
```
Day 1: 5-8 seconds (normal!)
Day 3: 3-5 seconds
Day 7: 2-3 seconds  
Day 14: 1-2 seconds
Day 30: Under 1 second (instant!)
```

**Solution:** Keep practicing at slow tempo (40-50 BPM)

---

#### Solution 2: Move Fingers as a UNIT
**Problem:** Moving one finger at a time
```
Wrong: Index... then middle... then ring...
       (Three separate movements = SLOW)

Right: Index + middle + ring together!
       (One movement = FAST)
```

**Practice fix:**
```
Exercise: Unit movement practice (5 minutes)

1. Form E major shape
2. Lift all three fingers AT ONCE (as a unit)
3. Move (still together) to new position
4. Land all three AT ONCE
5. Repeat 20 times

Your hand learns to move the SHAPE, not individual fingers
```

---

#### Solution 3: Anticipate Next Shape
**Mental preparation speeds physical movement**

âœ… **While playing current shape, think about next shape**
```
Playing E major â†’ Brain already sees A major position
Playing A major â†’ Brain already sees D shape position

Mental preparation = fingers move faster
```

**Practice fix:**
```
Exercise: Shape visualization (3 minutes)

1. Form E major shape
2. Before moving, VISUALIZE where A major fingers will go
3. See it in your mind
4. NOW move fingers
5. Repeat 15 times

Mental practice speeds up physical transitions!
```

---

#### Solution 4: Use the "One-Minute Changes" Exercise
**This exercise builds transition speed FAST**

âœ… **JustinGuitar's famous exercise:**
```
Set timer: 1 minute
Set metronome: 60 BPM

E major | A major | E major | A major | (repeat)
   1        1         1        1

Count how many clean transitions in 1 minute
Write down your number
Repeat daily
Watch number increase!

Typical progress:
Day 1: 10-15 transitions
Day 7: 25-30 transitions
Day 14: 35-40 transitions
```

**This ONE exercise will transform your transition speed!**

---

### Problem: Fingers Hurt Too Much

**Symptoms:**
- Intense pain in fingertips
- Can't practice for more than 10 minutes
- Fingertips are red or indented

**Solutions:**

#### Solution 1: Understanding Calluses
âœ… **Fingertip pain is NORMAL for beginners**
- You're building calluses (toughened skin)
- Takes 7-14 days to develop
- Once you have them, playing is painless!

**The process:**
```
Days 1-3: Significant pain (this is normal)
Days 4-7: Pain reducing, slight toughness
Days 8-14: Calluses forming, much less pain
Days 15+: Minimal to no pain (calluses established)
```

âœ… **This temporary pain = permanent calluses**

---

#### Solution 2: Practice in Shorter Sessions
**Instead of:** 45 minutes once per day
**Try:** 15 minutes, three times per day

âœ… **Why this works:**
- Builds calluses FASTER (more sessions)
- Hurts LESS (shorter duration each time)
- More learning (spaced repetition)

**Sample schedule:**
```
Morning: 15 minutes (shape formation)
Afternoon: 15 minutes (transitions)
Evening: 15 minutes (songs)

Total: 45 minutes (same as before)
Effect: Less pain, faster callus building, better learning!
```

---

#### Solution 3: Ice Fingers After Practice
âœ… **Reduce inflammation:**
```
After practice session:
1. Hold cold drink or ice pack
2. 2-3 minutes on fingertips
3. Reduces soreness
4. Speeds recovery
```

---

#### Solution 4: Check Technique (Might Be Pressing Too Hard!)
**Problem:** Death grip on neck
- Pressing WAY harder than needed
- Creates unnecessary pain

**Solution:**
âœ… **Press just hard enough for clear sound**
```
Test:
1. Form E major shape
2. Press very lightly (strings buzz)
3. Gradually increase pressure
4. Stop when buzzing stops
5. THAT'S the right pressure (not more!)

Extra pressure = Extra pain, NO benefit
```

---

#### Solution 5: Take a Rest Day (If Needed)
âœ… **When to take a day off:**
- Fingertips are raw or bleeding
- Sharp pain (not just soreness)
- Fingers extremely swollen

**Normal pain = Keep practicing**
**Injury signs = Take 24 hours off**

**After rest day, resume at 40 BPM slow practice**

---

### Problem: Can't Tell if Shapes Sound Right

**Symptoms:**
- Unsure if you're forming shapes correctly
- Can't hear if strings are buzzing
- Don't know what "good" should sound like

**Solutions:**

#### Solution 1: The Individual String Test
âœ… **Don't strum - pluck each string separately**
```
Process:
1. Form E major shape
2. Pluck low E string (open) - should ring clearly
3. Pluck A string (middle finger) - clear ring?
4. Pluck D string (ring finger) - clear ring?
5. Pluck G string (index finger) - clear ring?
6. Pluck B string (open) - clear ring?
7. Pluck high e string (open) - clear ring?

Any buzzing = That finger needs adjustment
```

**A "good" string:**
- Rings clearly like a bell
- Sustains (doesn't die immediately)
- No buzzing or muted sound

**A "bad" string:**
- Buzzes or sounds muted
- Dies quickly
- Sounds "choked"

---

#### Solution 2: Watch Video Examples
âœ… **Compare your sound to professionals**
```
Process:
1. Watch Den Lopez E major shape video
2. Listen carefully to how his E major sounds
3. Play your E major shape
4. Compare sounds
5. Adjust until yours matches
```

**Recommended comparison videos:**
- Den Lopez: "E major shape demo"
- JustinGuitar: "E major chord sound"
- Marty Music: "E major close-up"

---

#### Solution 3: Record Yourself
âœ… **Your ears hear differently when listening to recording**
```
Process:
1. Use phone voice recorder
2. Play E major shape 5 times
3. Play A major shape 5 times
4. Play back recording
5. Listen critically:
   - Clean sound?
   - Any buzzing?
   - Full, clear tone?
6. Compare to YouTube examples
```

**You'll hear things in recording you miss while playing!**

---

#### Solution 4: Ask for Help
âœ… **Get feedback from others**
- Friend who plays guitar
- Post video in r/guitar or beginner forums
- Ask local music store staff
- **Everyone is happy to help beginners!**

---

### Problem: Understanding "Shape" Concept is Confusing

**Symptoms:**
- "I don't get why this is a 'shape' and not just a chord"
- Shape philosophy doesn't make sense yet
- Wondering why we keep saying "shape"

**Solutions:**

#### Solution 1: Watch Den Lopez Videos
âœ… **He explains this BETTER than written text can**

**Must-watch:**
- "Shapes vs Chords - What's the Difference?"
- "The Five Essential Guitar Shapes"
- "Understanding the CAGED System"

**After watching:** The concept will click!

---

#### Solution 2: The "Aha!" Moment Exercise
âœ… **Experience WHY shapes matter:**
```
Exercise: Moving the E-Shape (3 minutes)

1. Form open E major shape (all open strings + 3 fingers)
2. Now slide your hand up to 3rd fret
3. Keep the same finger pattern
4. Strum (sounds terrible - don't worry!)
5. NOW add index finger across all strings at 3rd fret (barre)
6. Strum again
7. THIS IS G MAJOR!

YOU JUST MOVED THE E-SHAPE!

Same physical pattern (shape)
Different position (fret)
Different chord name (G instead of E)

THIS IS WHY IT'S CALLED A SHAPE!
```

**After doing this:** The light bulb turns on!

---

#### Solution 3: Read Lesson 4 Again
âœ… **The shape concept is introduced there**
- Lesson 4 explains shape philosophy in depth
- Maybe it makes more sense now that you've practiced
- Understanding grows with experience

---

#### Solution 4: Just Trust the Process
âœ… **It's okay if concept is fuzzy now**
- You're using shapes correctly (forming chord shapes)
- Deep understanding comes later
- By Lesson 21 (barre chords), you'll see why this matters
- For now: Just know E major is called "E-shape"

**The understanding will come!**

- More complex strumming patterns
- Fingerstyle technique
- Music reading introduction
- Performance techniques

**But first: Lesson 7 is your victory lap!** You'll review everything you've learned, play complete songs, and celebrate completing the Foundation Phase. This is a HUGE milestone!

---


## ðŸ’­ MOTIVATIONAL NOTE

### You're Building Something Amazing!

**Congratulations on learning E major and A major chord shapes!**

These aren't just "two more chords" - they're foundational shapes that open up entire genres of music:
- Rock classics (E major is THE rock chord!)
- Blues standards (E and A are blues staples)
- Folk songs (appear in nearly every folk progression)
- Pop hits (featured in countless chart-toppers)

**Here's what makes this lesson special:**

### The E-Shape: Your Gateway to Mastery

**E major shape is the MOST important movable shape in guitar.**

Why?
- Most rock songs use it (power chord root: E string)
- Most common barre chord shape (F, G, A, B, C all use E-shape)
- Most blues solos use it (E minor pentatonic)
- Most accessible shape for beginners moving to intermediate

**When you master open E major today**, you're preparing for:
- Lesson 21: F major barre chord (E-shape moved to 1st fret)
- Lesson 22: All major barre chords (E-shape moved up neck)
- Lesson 25-27: Lead guitar (E-shape scale positions)

**This ONE shape unlocks half the fretboard!**

---

### The Shape Philosophy is Clicking!

**By now, you should be seeing it:**

"Oh! Em shape + one finger = E major shape!"
"Wait... Am shape + one finger = A major shape!"
"They're all... PATTERNS!"

**YES! That's EXACTLY it!**

You're not learning "180 random chords."
You're learning "5-6 shape families with variations."

**This is how professionals think!**

When a pro guitarist sees "B major" in sheet music, they don't think:
"Ugh, what fingering is that again?"

They think:
"B major? That's E-shape at 7th fret!"

**Instant. Automatic. Shape thinking.**

**That's where you're headed!**

---

### You've Completed Foundation Phase Shapes!

**With E major and A major, you now have:**

**Your Complete Foundation Shape Vocabulary:**
1. Em shape âœ“
2. Am shape âœ“
3. D shape âœ“
4. G shape âœ“
5. C shape âœ“
6. E major shape âœ“ (NEW!)
7. A major shape âœ“ (NEW!)

**That's SEVEN chord shapes!**

**What can you do with seven shapes?**
- Play songs from 1950s to today
- Play folk, rock, pop, blues, country
- Play thousands of songs
- PERFORM for others!

---

### The Barre Chord Preview

**Here's a secret that will motivate you:**

Those barre chords everyone says are "so hard"?

**They're just the E major shape with one finger added.**

That's it. That's the "trick."

**F major barre chord** (everyone's nemesis):
```
It's just:
E major shape (you know this now!)
+ Index finger across all strings (1st fret)
= F major barre chord

THAT'S ALL IT IS!
```

**When you get to Lesson 21**, you'll realize:
"Wait... I already know this shape! I just need to add the bar!"

**Today's E major practice = Preparation for barre chords!**

You're not starting from zero when you hit Lesson 21.
You're starting from "I already know the shape!"

**That's huge!**

---

### Famous Guitarists & the E-Shape

**Every legendary guitarist built their career on E-shape:**

**Jimi Hendrix:**
- "Purple Haze"? E-shape (open and barre)
- "Hey Joe"? E-shape descending
- His entire style: E-shape based!

**Eric Clapton:**
- "Wonderful Tonight"? E-shape
- Blues solos? E-shape scale positions
- "Layla"? E-shape all over it

**Kurt Cobain:**
- "Smells Like Teen Spirit"? Power chords from E-shape
- Most Nirvana songs? E-shape based

**The Beatles:**
- "Love Me Do"? E and A shapes
- "Can't Buy Me Love"? E-shape
- Countless hits: E-shape foundation

**You're learning the EXACT SAME shape these legends used!**

---

### Your Progress is REAL

**Week 1 (Lesson 1):**
- "How do I even hold this guitar?"
- Two fingers hurting
- Em and Am shapes feel impossible

**Week 2-3 (Lessons 2-3):**
- "Okay, I can form shapes now..."
- D, G, C shapes learned
- Starting to switch between them

**Week 4-5 (Lessons 4-5):**
- "Wait, these are SHAPES?"
- Strumming patterns added
- Playing actual rhythms

**Week 6 (Lesson 6 - TODAY):**
- "I have SEVEN chord shapes!"
- E major and A major unlocked
- Playing rock songs
- Understanding movable shapes concept

**LOOK HOW FAR YOU'VE COME!**

Six weeks ago, you couldn't play ANYTHING.

Today:
- Seven chord shapes âœ“
- Multiple strumming patterns âœ“
- Complete songs âœ“
- Shape philosophy understanding âœ“
- Ready for Lesson 7 âœ“

**You're a GUITARIST now!**

---

### The Next Phase: Expansion (Lessons 8-14)

**After you complete Lesson 7, you enter Expansion Phase:**

**What's coming:**
- 7th chords (adding color to your shapes)
- Suspended chords (emotional variations)
- Advanced strumming (16th notes, syncopation)
- Fingerstyle technique (classical guitar intro)
- Music reading (tablature and notation)
- Performance skills (playing for others)

**But all of that builds on YOUR SEVEN FOUNDATION SHAPES.**

**The foundation is nearly complete!**

One more lesson (Lesson 7: Review & Assessment), then you're into the expansion phase!

---

### Keep Going!

**If E major feels hard today:**
- It won't in 3 days
- It won't in a week
- It definitely won't in a month

**Your fingers are ADAPTING:**
- Building calluses (pain goes away)
- Building strength (shapes get easier)
- Building memory (becoming automatic)
- Building connections (transitions smooth out)

**Every professional guitarist:**
- Struggled with E major at first
- Practiced slowly (just like you're doing)
- Built it up over days and weeks
- NOW it's instant and automatic

**That's your future too!**

---

### Final Thought

**You're not just learning "how to play E major chord."**

You're learning:
- How the guitar works (shape thinking)
- How to teach yourself (slow practice, tempo progression)
- How to overcome challenges (troubleshooting, persistence)
- How to be a musician (rhythm, timing, expression)

**These skills last a lifetime!**

---

**Now pick up that guitar and form that E major shape!**

**You've got this!** ðŸŽ¸ðŸ’ª
