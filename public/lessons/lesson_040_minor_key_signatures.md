## 🎵 WHY THIS MATTERS: READING MINOR KEY MUSIC

### The Question Every Musician Asks

**"This music has 1 sharp—is it G major or E minor?"**

**"How do I know if a song is in a major or minor key from the key signature alone?"**

**"Why do major and minor keys share the same key signatures?"**

**The answer: Relative major/minor relationships and key signature identification.**

**You learned major key signatures in Lessons 34-35.**

**Now you'll learn how minor keys use those SAME key signatures.**

---

### What You're About to Learn

**You already know:**
- All major key signatures (Lessons 34-35)

**Today you'll learn:**
- How to read minor key signatures
- The Circle of Fifths for minor keys
- Quick identification of major vs. minor keys
- **The complete Circle (major outer, minor inner)**

**After today:**
- Minor key signatures will be as easy as major
- You'll navigate the complete Circle of Fifths
- Reading minor key music will be effortless
- **You'll think in both major AND minor keys simultaneously**

This completes your key signature mastery.

## 📖 SECTION 1: MINOR KEY SIGNATURES EXPLAINED

### The Fundamental Principle

**Every minor key shares its key signature with a relative major key.**

**Why?**

Because the **natural minor scale** uses the same notes as its relative major, just starting from a different note.

**C Major:** C - D - E - F - G - A - B - C  
**A Natural Minor:** A - B - C - D - E - F - G - A

**Same notes = same key signature (no sharps or flats)**

**This relationship holds for ALL 12 keys.**

---

### Relative Major/Minor Pairs

**Key signature: No sharps, no flats**
- **C Major** / **A minor**

**Key signature: 1 sharp (F#)**
- **G Major** / **E minor**

**Key signature: 2 sharps (F#, C#)**
- **D Major** / **B minor**

**Key signature: 3 sharps (F#, C#, G#)**
- **A Major** / **F# minor**

**Key signature: 4 sharps (F#, C#, G#, D#)**
- **E Major** / **C# minor**

**And so on...**

**Every major key has a relative minor partner that shares the same key signature.**

---

### Finding the Relative Minor

**From major key → relative minor:**

**Go DOWN 3 half steps (minor 3rd) from the major tonic.**

**Examples:**

**C major → Count down 3 half steps:**  
C → B (1) → Bb (2) → A (3)  
**Relative minor: A minor**

**G major → Count down 3 half steps:**  
G → F# (1) → F (2) → E (3)  
**Relative minor: E minor**

**D major → Count down 3 half steps:**  
D → C# (1) → C (2) → B (3)  
**Relative minor: B minor**

---

**Or use the scale degree method (easier):**

**Relative minor = 6th scale degree of the major scale**

**C major scale:** C - D - E - F - G - **A** - B - C  
6th degree = A  
**Relative minor: A minor**

**G major scale:** G - A - B - C - D - **E** - F# - G  
6th degree = E  
**Relative minor: E minor**

---

### Finding the Relative Major

**From minor key → relative major:**

**Go UP 3 half steps (minor 3rd) from the minor tonic.**

**Examples:**

**A minor → Count up 3 half steps:**  
A → Bb (1) → B (2) → C (3)  
**Relative major: C major**

**E minor → Count up 3 half steps:**  
E → F (1) → F# (2) → G (3)  
**Relative major: G major**

**B minor → Count up 3 half steps:**  
B → C (1) → C# (2) → D (3)  
**Relative major: D major**

## 📖 SECTION 3: THE CIRCLE OF FIFTHS FOR MINOR KEYS

### The Complete Circle (Major + Minor)

**The Circle of Fifths includes BOTH major and minor keys:**

```
              C / Am
             ▒       ▓
        F / Dm         G / Em
        ▒               ▓
   Bb / Gm              D / Bm
     ▒                   ▓
Eb / Cm                  A / F#m
   ▒                       ▓
Ab / Fm                    E / C#m
   ▓                       ▒
Db / Bbm                  B / G#m
     ▓                   ▒
   Gb / Ebm         F# / D#m
        ▓           ▒
     Cb / Abm = B / G#m

Outer circle: MAJOR KEYS
Inner circle: MINOR KEYS
```

**Each position on the circle has TWO keys:**
- **Outer:** Major key
- **Inner:** Relative minor (shares same key signature)

---

### Moving Around the Circle (Minor Keys)

**Clockwise (adding sharps):**

**A minor (0)** → **E minor (1♯)** → **B minor (2♯)** → **F# minor (3♯)** → **C# minor (4♯)** → **G# minor (5♯)** → **D# minor (6♯)** → **A# minor (7♯)**

Each step clockwise adds one sharp (same order: F-C-G-D-A-E-B)

---

**Counter-clockwise (adding flats):**

**A minor (0)** → **D minor (1♭)** → **G minor (2♭)** → **C minor (3♭)** → **F minor (4♭)** → **Bb minor (5♭)** → **Eb minor (6♭)** → **Ab minor (7♭)**

Each step counter-clockwise adds one flat (same order: B-E-A-D-G-C-F)

---

### Identifying Major vs. Minor From Key Signature

**Problem:** A key signature tells you the sharps/flats, but not whether it's major or minor.

**Example:** 1 sharp (F#) = G major OR E minor

**How to tell which?**

**Look at the music:**

1. **What's the first chord?** (Usually the tonic)
   - If it's G major → probably G major key
   - If it's E minor → probably E minor key

2. **What's the last chord?** (Usually resolves to tonic)
   - Ends on G major → G major key
   - Ends on E minor → E minor key

3. **What accidentals appear?** (Altered notes)
   - If you see D# often → probably E harmonic minor (raised 7th)
   - If no accidentals → could be either (look at chords)

4. **Overall mood/sound**
   - Bright, happy → major key
   - Dark, sad → minor key

**In sheet music, composers often write "in E minor" to avoid ambiguity.**

---

## 📖 SECTION 4: TRANSPOSING TO MINOR KEYS

### Transposing a Minor Key Song

**Task: Transpose "House of the Rising Sun" (A minor) to D minor**

**Original key: A minor**
- Key signature: No sharps or flats (same as C major)
- Chords: Am - C - D - F - Am - E - Am - E

---

**New key: D minor**
- Key signature: 1 flat (Bb) - same as F major
- Relative major: F major

**Transposition method: Interval-based**

A minor → D minor = up a perfect 4th (or down a perfect 5th)

**Apply the same interval to each chord:**

**Original (A minor):**
- Am → Dm (up a 4th)
- C → F (up a 4th)
- D → G (up a 4th)
- F → Bb (up a 4th)
- E → A (up a 4th)

**Result in D minor:**
**Dm - F - G - Bb - Dm - A - Dm - A**

---

**Or use Roman numerals (more reliable):**

**Analyze original progression in A minor:**
- Am = i (tonic minor)
- C = III (relative major)
- D = IV (subdominant)
- F = VI (submediant)
- E = V (dominant)

**Apply Roman numerals in D minor:**
- i = Dm
- III = F
- IV = G
- VI = Bb
- V = A

**Same result: Dm - F - G - Bb - Dm - A - Dm - A**

---

## 📖 SECTION 5: HARMONIC & MELODIC MINOR KEY SIGNATURES

### Important Note About Key Signatures

**Key signatures show ONLY the natural minor scale.**

**Harmonic and melodic minor use accidentals** (♯, ♮, ♭ symbols in the music).

---

**Example: A Minor Key Signature**

**Key signature:** No sharps or flats

**In the music:**
- **A natural minor:** Uses no accidentals (A-B-C-D-E-F-G-A)
- **A harmonic minor:** Adds G# as an accidental (raised 7th)
- **A melodic minor:** Adds F# and G# as accidentals (raised 6th & 7th ascending)

**The key signature doesn't change for harmonic or melodic minor.**  
**The raised notes appear as accidentals in the actual music.**

---

**Example: E Minor Key Signature**

**Key signature:** 1 sharp (F#)

**In the music:**
- **E natural minor:** Uses F# from key signature (E-F#-G-A-B-C-D-E)
- **E harmonic minor:** Adds D# as accidental (raised 7th)
- **E melodic minor:** Adds C# and D# as accidentals (raised 6th & 7th ascending)

**The composer writes the accidentals where needed in the score.**

---

   - **Answer: G minor** ✜

---

### Exercise 4: Transpose to Minor Keys (20 minutes)

**Transpose this progression from E minor to D minor:**

**Original (E minor):**  
Em - G - D - Am - Em

**Analyze with Roman numerals in E minor:**
- Em = i
- G = III
- D = VI
- Am = iv
- Em = i

**Apply to D minor:**
- i = Dm
- III = F
- VI = Bb
- iv = Gm
- i = Dm

**Result: Dm - F - Bb - Gm - Dm** ✜
