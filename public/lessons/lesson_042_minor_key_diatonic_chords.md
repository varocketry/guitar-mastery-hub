## 🎵 WHY THIS MATTERS: THE HARMONY OF EMOTION

### The Question Every Songwriter Asks

**"Why do minor key progressions sound so different from major key progressions?"**

**"What chords naturally fit together in a minor key?"**

**"Why does the V chord in minor keys sometimes sound 'wrong'?"**

**The answer: Minor key diatonic harmony.**

Just like major keys have seven diatonic chords following a pattern, **minor keys have their own seven-chord pattern.**

**But it's different. Very different.**

## 📖 SECTION 1: BUILDING DIATONIC CHORDS FROM NATURAL MINOR

### The Natural Minor Chord Pattern

**From Lesson 36, you learned the major key pattern:**  
**I - ii - iii - IV - V - vi - vii°**

**Minor keys have a DIFFERENT pattern:**  
**i - ii° - III - iv - v - VI - VII**

**Notice the differences:**
- Lowercase "i" = minor tonic (not major I)
- "ii°" = diminished (not minor ii)
- "III" = MAJOR third chord (not minor iii)
- "v" = minor dominant (not major V) ← **This is important!**
- "VII" = MAJOR seventh chord (not diminished vii°)

**This pattern NEVER changes in natural minor.**

---

### Building A Minor Diatonic Chords (Natural Minor)

**A Natural Minor Scale:** A - B - C - D - E - F - G - A

**Build chords using 1-3-5 pattern:**

---

**Chord i (built on A - Tonic):**
```
A  B  C  D  E  F  G  A
1     3     5

Chord: A - C - E = A MINOR (i)
```

Minor 3rd (A to C = 3 half steps) → **Minor chord**

---

**Chord ii° (built on B - Supertonic):**
```
A  B  C  D  E  F  G  A
   1     3     5

Chord: B - D - F = B DIMINISHED (ii°)
```

Minor 3rd (B to D = 3 half steps) + diminished 5th (B to F = 6 half steps) → **Diminished chord**

---

**Chord III (built on C - Mediant):**
```
A  B  C  D  E  F  G  A
      1     3     5

Chord: C - E - G = C MAJOR (III)
```

Major 3rd (C to E = 4 half steps) → **Major chord**

---

**Chord iv (built on D - Subdominant):**
```
A  B  C  D  E  F  G  A
         1     3     5

Chord: D - F - A = D MINOR (iv)
```

Minor 3rd (D to F = 3 half steps) → **Minor chord**

---

**Chord v (built on E - Dominant):**
```
A  B  C  D  E  F  G  A
            1     3     5

Chord: E - G - B = E MINOR (v)
```

Minor 3rd (E to G = 3 half steps) → **Minor chord**

**IMPORTANT:** In major keys, V is MAJOR. In natural minor, v is MINOR.

**This creates a problem** (we'll solve it in Section 2).

---

**Chord VI (built on F - Submediant):**
```
A  B  C  D  E  F  G  A
               1     3     5

Chord: F - A - C = F MAJOR (VI)
```

Major 3rd (F to A = 4 half steps) → **Major chord**

---

**Chord VII (built on G - Subtonic):**
```
A  B  C  D  E  F  G  A
                  1     3     5

Chord: G - B - D = G MAJOR (VII)
```

Major 3rd (G to B = 4 half steps) → **Major chord**

**Note:** In major keys, vii° is diminished. In natural minor, VII is MAJOR.

---

### The Natural Minor Chord Pattern Summary

**In A Minor (Natural Minor):**

```
i   = A minor (A-C-E)
ii° = B diminished (B-D-F)
III = C major (C-E-G)
iv  = D minor (D-F-A)
v   = E minor (E-G-B)
VI  = F major (F-A-C)
VII = G major (G-B-D)
```

**Pattern (always the same in natural minor):**  
**i - ii° - III - iv - v - VI - VII**

**Memorize this pattern. It works in ALL 12 minor keys.**

---

### Quick Reference: All Minor Keys (Natural Minor)

**A Minor:** Am - Bdim - C - Dm - Em - F - G  
**E Minor:** Em - F#dim - G - Am - Bm - C - D  
**B Minor:** Bm - C#dim - D - Em - F#m - G - A  
**D Minor:** Dm - Edim - F - Gm - Am - Bb - C  
**G Minor:** Gm - Adim - Bb - Cm - Dm - Eb - F  
**C Minor:** Cm - Ddim - Eb - Fm - Gm - Ab - Bb

**Pattern is ALWAYS: i - ii° - III - iv - v - VI - VII**

---

## 📖 SECTION 2: THE HARMONIC MINOR SOLUTION

### The Problem with Natural Minor v Chord

**In major keys:**  
V chord (MAJOR) → I chord = **Strong resolution**

**Example in C major:**  
G major (V) → C major (I) = Feels complete, resolved

**Why?** The leading tone (B) in G major pulls strongly to C.

---

**In natural minor keys:**  
v chord (MINOR) → i chord = **Weak resolution**

**Example in A minor:**  
E minor (v) → A minor (i) = Feels incomplete, weak

**Why?** E minor has G (natural 7th), not G# (leading tone). No strong pull to A.

**This is a problem.**

Minor keys NEED strong dominant resolution for cadences (endings).

---

### The Harmonic Minor Solution

**Remember harmonic minor from Lesson 39?**

**A Harmonic Minor:** A - B - C - D - E - F - **G#** - A

**The 7th degree is raised (G → G#).**

**This creates a leading tone (G#) that pulls to A.**

**Now let's build the V chord:**

```
Build chord on E (5th degree):
E  F  G#  A  B  C  D  E
1     3      5

Chord: E - G# - B = E MAJOR (V)
```

**E major has G# (the leading tone!).**

**Now:** E major (V) → A minor (i) = **Strong resolution** ✓

---

### Harmonic Minor Changes the Chord Pattern

**When using harmonic minor (raised 7th), THREE chords change:**

**Natural minor:** i - ii° - III - iv - **v** - VI - **VII**  
**Harmonic minor:** i - ii° - **III+** - iv - **V** - VI - **vii°**

**Changes:**
1. **III becomes III+** (augmented chord - rare)
2. **v becomes V** (MAJOR dominant - common!)
3. **VII becomes vii°** (diminished leading tone chord)

**In practice:**

**Most minor key songs use:**
- Natural minor for i, ii°, iv, VI
- Harmonic minor for **V** (major dominant)
- **This is the best of both worlds**

**Example in A minor:**
- Use: Am, Bdim, Dm, F (from natural minor)
- Use: **E major** (from harmonic minor)
- Result: Strong dominant resolution

---

## 📖 SECTION 3: CHORD FAMILIES IN MINOR KEYS

### The Three Chord Families (Minor Version)

**Just like major keys, minor keys have three chord families:**

---

**TONIC FAMILY (Home/Stability)**
- **i** (minor) - Primary tonic, strongest resolution
- **III** (major) - Relative major, stable substitute
- **VI** (major) - Submediant, tonic substitute

**Function:** Rest, resolution, home (but darker than major)  
**Feel:** Complete, settled, emotional

---

**SUBDOMINANT FAMILY (Pre-dominant/Movement)**
- **iv** (minor) - Primary subdominant
- **ii°** (diminished) - Weak subdominant (rarely used alone)

**Function:** Moves away from tonic, builds tension  
**Feel:** Moving, transitioning, searching

---

**DOMINANT FAMILY (Tension/Resolution)**
- **V** (MAJOR - from harmonic minor) - Primary dominant
- **v** (minor - from natural minor) - Weak dominant (less common)
- **vii°** (diminished - from harmonic minor) - Leading tone chord

**Function:** Creates tension that resolves to tonic  
**Feel:** Unstable, needs resolution to i

---

### Why These Families Matter

**Strong minor progression (using families):**

```
i → iv → V → i
(Tonic → Subdominant → Dominant → Tonic)
(Home → Away → Tension → Home)

Example in A minor: Am - Dm - E - Am
```

**This uses V (MAJOR from harmonic minor) for strong resolution.**

**Weak minor progression:**

```
i → iv → v → i
(Using natural minor v = E minor)

Example in A minor: Am - Dm - Em - Am
```

**Sounds softer, less resolved. Not as strong.**

**Most professional minor key music uses V (major) for dominant.**

---

## 📖 SECTION 4: COMMON MINOR KEY PROGRESSIONS

### Progression 1: i-iv-V-i (The Classic Minor Progression)

**In A Minor: Am - Dm - E - Am**

**Roman Numerals: i - iv - V - i**

**Why it works:**
```
Am (i)  = Tonic, home
Dm (iv) = Subdominant, moves away
E (V)   = Major dominant (from harmonic minor), strong tension
Am (i)  = Tonic, resolution
```

**This is the minor key equivalent of I-IV-V-I.**

**Used in thousands of songs:**
- "House of the Rising Sun" (uses variation)
- "Losing My Religion" - R.E.M.
- "All Along the Watchtower"
- Classical music (countless examples)

---

### Progression 2: i-VI-III-VII (The Andalusian Cadence)

**In A Minor: Am - F - C - G**

**Roman Numerals: i - VI - III - VII**

**Why it works:**
```
Am (i)  = Tonic minor, dark start
F (VI)  = Submediant major, brightens slightly
C (III) = Relative major, more light
G (VII) = Subtonic major, returns toward minor
```

**This creates a descending bass line: A - F - C - G**

**Character:**
- Spanish/flamenco sound
- Dramatic, passionate
- Circular progression (loops well)

**Used in:**
- "Sultans of Swing" - Dire Straits
- "Runaway" - Del Shannon (variation)
- Flamenco guitar music
- "Hit the Road Jack"

---

### Progression 3: i-VII-VI-VII (Minor Rock Progression)

**In A Minor: Am - G - F - G**

**Roman Numerals: i - VII - VI - VII**

**Why it works:**
- Uses only natural minor chords
- No leading tone needed
- Power chord-friendly
- Rock/metal sound

**Used in:**
- "Stairway to Heaven" verse (A minor section)
- Metal riffs
- Rock ballads

---

### Progression 4: i-v-VI-III (Modal Minor)

**In A Minor: Am - Em - F - C**

**Roman Numerals: i - v - VI - III**

**Why it works:**
- Uses natural minor v (not V major)
- Softer, less resolved sound
- Folk/modal quality

**Used in:**
- Folk music
- Indie/alternative
- Softer ballads

---

### Progression 5: i-iv-i-V (Back-and-Forth)

**In A Minor: Am - Dm - Am - E**

**Roman Numerals: i - iv - i - V**

**Why it works:**
- Returns to i before V
- Emphasizes tonic
- V creates tension for next phrase

**Used in:**
- Blues-influenced minor songs
- 12-bar minor blues (variation)

---

## 📖 SECTION 5: DIFFERENCES FROM MAJOR KEY HARMONY

### Major vs. Minor Chord Patterns Compared

**Major Key Pattern:**  
**I - ii - iii - IV - V - vi - vii°**

**Minor Key Pattern (Natural Minor):**  
**i - ii° - III - iv - v - VI - VII**

**What changed:**

| Degree | Major Key    | Minor Key     | Change            |
|--------|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| 1      | I (major)    | i (minor)     | Became minor      |
| 2      | ii (minor)   | ii° (dim)     | Became diminished |
| 3      | iii (minor)  | III (major)   | Became major      |
| 4      | IV (major)   | iv (minor)    | Became minor      |
| 5      | V (major)    | v (minor)*    | Became minor*     |
| 6      | vi (minor)   | VI (major)    | Became major      |
| 7      | vii° (dim)   | VII (major)   | Became major      |

***Note:** In practice, V is often MAJOR (borrowed from harmonic minor)

---

### Emotional Differences

**Major Key Harmony:**
- Bright, happy, uplifting
- Strong sense of resolution (V → I is powerful)
- Positive, optimistic character

**Minor Key Harmony:**
- Dark, sad, emotional
- Introspective, serious
- Can feel unresolved (if using v instead of V)
- Dramatic, passionate (especially with V major)

---

## 📖 SECTION 6: PRACTICAL EXERCISES

### Exercise 1: Build Minor Key Diatonic Chords (15 minutes)

**Build all seven diatonic chords in E minor:**

**E Natural Minor Scale:** E - F# - G - A - B - C - D - E

```
i   = E minor (E-G-B)
ii° = F# diminished (F#-A-C)
III = G major (G-B-D)
iv  = A minor (A-C-E)
v   = B minor (B-D-F#)
VI  = C major (C-E-G)
VII = D major (D-F#-A)
```

**Now add harmonic minor V:**

**E Harmonic Minor:** E - F# - G - A - B - C - **D#** - E

```
V = B major (B-D#-F#) ← From harmonic minor
```

---

**Build all seven diatonic chords in D minor:**

**D Natural Minor Scale:** D - E - F - G - A - Bb - C - D

```
i   = D minor (D-F-A)
ii° = E diminished (E-G-Bb)
III = F major (F-A-C)
iv  = G minor (G-Bb-D)
v   = A minor (A-C-E)
VI  = Bb major (Bb-D-F)
VII = C major (C-E-G)
```

**Harmonic minor V:**

**D Harmonic Minor:** D - E - F - G - A - Bb - **C#** - D

```
V = A major (A-C#-E) ← From harmonic minor
```

---

### Exercise 2: Analyze Minor Progressions (15 minutes)

**Identify Roman numerals for these progressions:**

**1. "House of the Rising Sun" (A minor)**  
Chords: Am - C - D - F - Am - E - Am - E

Roman numerals:
- Am = i
- C = III
- D = IV (borrowed from A major!)
- F = VI
- E = V (harmonic minor)

**Analysis:** i - III - IV - VI - i - V - i - V

---

**2. Simple minor progression (E minor)**  
Chords: Em - Am - B - Em

Roman numerals:
- Em = i
- Am = iv
- B = V (harmonic minor)
- Em = i

**Analysis:** i - iv - V - i ✓ (Classic minor progression)

---

### Exercise 3: Write Original Minor Progressions (20 minutes)

**In A minor, create progressions using:**

**1. Classic i-iv-V-i:**
Am - Dm - E - Am

**2. Andalusian cadence (i-VI-III-VII):**
Am - F - C - G

**3. Your own progression using at least 4 chords:**
(Your choice - experiment!)

**Play each on guitar and listen to the emotional quality.**

---

### Exercise 4: Major vs. Minor Comparison (15 minutes)

**Take the same progression in both major and minor:**

**In C Major:**  
C - F - G - C (I-IV-V-I)

**In C Minor:**  
Cm - Fm - G - Cm (i-iv-V-i)

**Play both on guitar back-to-back.**

**Notice:**
- Same structure (i/I - iv/IV - V - i/I)
- Completely different emotional feel
- Minor version uses Cm and Fm (darker)
- Both use G major (V) for strong resolution
