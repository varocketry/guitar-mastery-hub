### The Five Core Skills of Major Key Mastery

**Skill 1: Scale Construction**
- Given any root note, build the major scale using W-W-H-W-W-W-H
- Example: "Build Eb major scale" → Eb-F-G-Ab-Bb-C-D-Eb

**Skill 2: Key Signature Recognition**
- Given sharps or flats, identify the key instantly
- Example: See 4 sharps → Know it's E major

**Skill 3: Diatonic Chord Construction**
- Given a key, build all seven diatonic chords
- Example: "What are the diatonic chords in A major?" → A-Bm-C#m-D-E-F#m-G#dim

**Skill 4: Harmonic Analysis**
- Given a chord progression, identify Roman numerals and function
- Example: G-C-D-G → I-IV-V-I (Tonic-Subdominant-Dominant-Tonic)

**Skill 5: Voice Leading Application**
- Given a progression, add inversions for smooth voice leading
- Example: C-F-G-C → C-F/A-G/B-C (smoother bass line)

**Master these five skills, and you've mastered major key theory.**

## 📖 SECTION 2: COMPREHENSIVE INTEGRATION EXERCISES

### Integration Exercise 1: Key of G Major (Complete Analysis)

**Task: Demonstrate complete understanding of G major**

---

**Step 1: Build the G Major Scale**

Formula: W-W-H-W-W-W-H

```
G → A = 2 frets (W)
A → B = 2 frets (W)
B → C = 1 fret (H)
C → D = 2 frets (W)
D → E = 2 frets (W)
E → F# = 2 frets (W)
F# → G = 1 fret (H)

G Major Scale: G - A - B - C - D - E - F# - G
```

✜ Scale degree names: Tonic (G), Supertonic (A), Mediant (B), Subdominant (C), Dominant (D), Submediant (E), Leading Tone (F#)

---

**Step 2: Identify the Key Signature**

G major has **1 sharp: F#**

Why? Because the major scale formula requires F# (not F) between E and G for the correct whole step.

**Circle of Fifths position:** One step clockwise from C major

---

**Step 3: Build All Diatonic Chords**

Pattern: I-ii-iii-IV-V-vi-viiÂ°

```
I   = G major (G-B-D)
ii  = A minor (A-C-E)
iii = B minor (B-D-F#)
IV  = C major (C-E-G)
V   = D major (D-F#-A)
vi  = E minor (E-G-B)
viiÂ°= F# diminished (F#-A-C)
```

---

**Step 4: Analyze Common Progressions in G Major**

**Progression 1: G - C - D - G**
- Roman Numerals: I - IV - V - I
- Function: Tonic → Subdominant → Dominant → Tonic
- Character: Strong, complete, resolved
- Used in: Thousands of folk and country songs

**Progression 2: G - D - Em - C**
- Roman Numerals: I - V - vi - IV
- Function: Tonic → Dominant → Relative Minor → Subdominant
- Character: Pop, emotional, very singable
- Used in: "Let It Be" pattern in G major

**Progression 3: G - Em - C - D**
- Roman Numerals: I - vi - IV - V
- Function: Classic '50s progression
- Character: Smooth, nostalgic
- Used in: "Stand By Me" pattern in G major

---

**Step 5: Add Voice Leading with Inversions**

**Original: G - C - D - G**  
Bass jumps: G → C → D → G

**With inversions: G - C/E - D/F# - G**  
Bass ascends smoothly: G → E → F# → G

**Or: G - C - D/F# - G**  
Bass: G → C → F# → G (smoother return to G)

---

**✜ Complete G Major Integration Demonstrated**

---

### Integration Exercise 2: Key of F Major (Complete Analysis)

**Task: Demonstrate complete understanding of F major**

---

**Step 1: Build the F Major Scale**

```
F → G = W
G → A = W
A → Bb = H (A to B is whole step, need half step)
Bb → C = W
C → D = W
D → E = W
E → F = H

F Major Scale: F - G - A - Bb - C - D - E - F
```

---

**Step 2: Key Signature**

F major has **1 flat: Bb**

**Circle of Fifths position:** One step counter-clockwise from C major

---

**Step 3: Diatonic Chords**

```
I   = F major (F-A-C)
ii  = G minor (G-Bb-D)
iii = A minor (A-C-E)
IV  = Bb major (Bb-D-F)
V   = C major (C-E-G)
vi  = D minor (D-F-A)
viiÂ°= E diminished (E-G-Bb)
```

---

**Step 4: Common Progressions in F Major**

**F - Bb - C - F** (I-IV-V-I)  
**F - C - Dm - Bb** (I-V-vi-IV)  
**F - Dm - Bb - C** (I-vi-IV-V)

---

**Step 5: Voice Leading**

**F - Bb/D - C/E - F**  
Bass: F → D → E → F (smooth, ascending)

---

**✜ Complete F Major Integration Demonstrated**

---

### Integration Exercise 3: Transposing a Progression

**Task: Transpose "Let It Be" progression to different keys**

**Original (C Major): C - G - Am - F** (I-V-vi-IV)

---

**To G Major:**
- I = G, V = D, vi = Em, IV = C
- **G - D - Em - C**

---

**To D Major:**
- I = D, V = A, vi = Bm, IV = G
- **D - A - Bm - G**

---

**To A Major:**
- I = A, V = E, vi = F#m, IV = D
- **A - E - F#m - D**

---

**To F Major:**
- I = F, V = C, vi = Dm, IV = Bb
- **F - C - Dm - Bb**

**Same progression, five different keys, all using Roman numeral system.**

**This is the power of understanding theory!**

---

## 📖 SECTION 3: SONG ANALYSIS PRACTICE

### Analyzing "Stand By Me" (Ben E. King) - Key of A Major

**Chord progression: A - F#m - D - E**

---

**Step 1: Identify the Key**

Song centers on A, chords contain C# and F# (key signature of A major = 3 sharps)

**Key: A Major**

---

**Step 2: Build A Major Scale**

**A - B - C# - D - E - F# - G# - A**

---

**Step 3: Identify Diatonic Chords**

```
I   = A major
ii  = B minor
iii = C# minor
IV  = D major
V   = E major
vi  = F# minor
viiÂ°= G# diminished
```

---

**Step 4: Analyze the Progression**

**A - F#m - D - E**

- A = I (Tonic)
- F#m = vi (Submediant, relative minor)
- D = IV (Subdominant)
- E = V (Dominant)

**Roman Numerals: I - vi - IV - V**

**Function:**
- Starts at home (I)
- Moves to relative minor (vi) for emotional color
- Leaves home via subdominant (IV)
- Creates tension with dominant (V)
- (Loops back to I for resolution)

**This is the classic '50s progression.**

---

**Step 5: Voice Leading Analysis**

**Bass line (root position): A - F# - D - E**

Large jump from A to F#, then another jump to D.

**With inversions: A - F#m/A - D - E**

Bass: A - A - D - E (smoother, keeps A longer)

**Or: A - F#m - D/F# - E**

Bass: A - F# - F# - E (holds F#, then smooth to E)

### Analyzing "Let It Be" (The Beatles) - Key of C Major

**Chord progression (verse): C - G - Am - F**

---

**Quick analysis:**

**Key:** C Major (no sharps/flats)  
**Scale:** C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C  
**Progression:** I-V-vi-IV  
**Function:** Tonic → Dominant → Relative Minor → Subdominant

**With inversions (common): C - G/B - Am - F**

Bass: C - B - A - F (descending then jump)

**Why this progression is so popular:**
- Starts strong (I)
- Immediate tension (V)
- Emotional depth (vi)
- Sets up return to I (IV)

---

## 📖 SECTION 4: ORIGINAL COMPOSITION EXERCISES

### Composition Exercise 1: Write a 4-Chord Progression

**Task: Create an original 4-chord progression in D major**

**D Major diatonic chords:**
I=D, ii=Em, iii=F#m, IV=G, V=A, vi=Bm, viiÂ°=C#dim

---

**Example 1 (Strong, traditional):**
**D - G - A - D** (I-IV-V-I)

Starts home, leaves home, creates tension, resolves home.

---

**Example 2 (Emotional, modern):**
**D - A - Bm - G** (I-V-vi-IV)

The "pop" progression in D major.

---

**Example 3 (Sophisticated):**
**D - Em - A - D** (I-ii-V-I)

Jazz influence, ii-V-I is classic jazz progression.

---

**Example 4 (Unique):**
**D - F#m - G - A** (I-iii-IV-V)

Less common, uses the iii chord for different color.

---

**Your turn: Create 3 original progressions in D major**

Use different combinations of I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi.

Remember: iii and viiÂ° are less common but available!

Play each on guitar. Which sounds best to you?

---

### Composition Exercise 2: Add a Melody

**Task: Create a simple melody over your D major progression**

**Use only notes from the D major scale:**  
D - E - F# - G - A - B - C#

**Guidelines:**
- Start and end on D (tonic) for resolution
- Use stepwise motion (whole and half steps) mostly
- Save leaps for dramatic moments
- Match melody rhythm to chord changes

**Example over D-G-A-D:**

```
D chord:  D - E - F# (ascending)
G chord:  G - A (ascending)
A chord:  A - B - C# (ascending)
D chord:  D (resolution)
```

Simple ascending melody over the progression.

**Now create your own melody over your original progression.**

---

### Composition Exercise 3: Apply Voice Leading

**Task: Take one of your progressions and add inversions**

**Original: D - G - A - D**

**With inversions: D - G/B - A/C# - D**

Bass: D → B → C# → D (ascending smoothly!)

**Or: D - G - A/C# - D**

Bass: D → G → C# → D (emphasizes the G, then smooth to D)

**Try multiple inversion combinations.**

Which creates the best voice leading for your musical intent?

---

## 📖 SECTION 6: PREPARING FOR MINOR KEYS

### What's Next: Theory Module 2 (Lessons 39-46)

**You've mastered major key theory.**

**Next, you'll learn:**
- Minor scales (natural, harmonic, melodic)
- Minor key signatures
- Minor key diatonic chords
- Minor key progressions
- Relative major/minor relationships
- **Complete understanding of both major AND minor tonalities**

---

### Preview: Relative Minor

**Every major key has a relative minor** that shares the same key signature.

**Examples:**
- C major / A minor (both have no sharps/flats)
- G major / E minor (both have 1 sharp: F#)
- D major / B minor (both have 2 sharps: F#, C#)

**Relative minor = 6th scale degree of major scale**

In C major: C-D-E-F-G-**A**-B-C  
A is the 6th → A minor is relative minor

**This relationship will be crucial in Theory Module 2.**

---

### The Bridge Between Modules

**Major key theory teaches:**
- How keys are organized
- How chords function
- How progressions work
- Voice leading principles

**Minor key theory will:**
- Show you the "other half" of music
- Teach emotional depth through minor tonality
- Complete your harmonic understanding
- **Make you fluent in all Western music**

**Major keys = bright, stable, resolved**  
**Minor keys = dark, emotional, introspective**

**Master both = complete musician**
