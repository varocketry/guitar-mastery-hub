## 🎵 WHY THIS MATTERS: THE SECRET CODE OF SONGWRITING

### The Question Every Songwriter Asks

**"Why do certain chords sound good together?"**

**"How do I know which chords fit in my song?"**

**"What makes I-IV-V sound 'complete' but iii-vi sound 'unfinished'?"**

**The answer: Diatonic harmony and harmonic function.**

Every major key has **seven diatonic chords** built from its scale.

These chords follow predictable patterns of tension and resolution.

**Learn this system, and you'll understand 95% of popular music.**

## 📖 SECTION 1: BUILDING DIATONIC CHORDS

### What Are Diatonic Chords?

**Diatonic chords:** Chords built using ONLY notes from a specific major scale.

**In C Major:**
- Scale: C - D - E - F - G - A - B - C
- Diatonic chords: Use only these seven notes
- No sharps, no flats, no "outside" notes

**Every major key has exactly SEVEN diatonic chords** (one built on each scale degree).

---

### Building Chords from Scale Degrees (Review)

**From Lesson 32, you learned:**

Chords are built by stacking thirds (every other note) from the scale.

**Formula: 1-3-5**
- Take the root note (scale degree)
- Skip one note (the 2nd)
- Add the 3rd
- Skip one note (the 4th)
- Add the 5th

**Example: Build a chord on C (1st scale degree of C major)**

```
C Major Scale: C  D  E  F  G  A  B  C
               1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8

C chord (I):   C     E     G
               1     3     5

Result: C major chord (C-E-G)
```

**Now let's build chords on ALL seven scale degrees.**

---

### The Seven Diatonic Chords in C Major

**Scale: C - D - E - F - G - A - B - C**

---

**Chord I (built on C - Tonic):**
```
C  D  E  F  G  A  B  C
1     3     5

Chord: C - E - G = C MAJOR (I)
```

---

**Chord ii (built on D - Supertonic):**
```
C  D  E  F  G  A  B  C
   1     3     5

Chord: D - F - A = D MINOR (ii)
```

**Why minor?**
D to F = 3 half steps (minor 3rd)

---

**Chord iii (built on E - Mediant):**
```
C  D  E  F  G  A  B  C
      1     3     5

Chord: E - G - B = E MINOR (iii)
```

**Why minor?**
E to G = 3 half steps (minor 3rd)

---

**Chord IV (built on F - Subdominant):**
```
C  D  E  F  G  A  B  C
         1     3     5

Chord: F - A - C = F MAJOR (IV)
```

**Why major?**
F to A = 4 half steps (major 3rd)

---

**Chord V (built on G - Dominant):**
```
C  D  E  F  G  A  B  C
            1     3     5

Chord: G - B - D = G MAJOR (V)
```

**Why major?**
G to B = 4 half steps (major 3rd)

---

**Chord vi (built on A - Submediant):**
```
C  D  E  F  G  A  B  C
               1     3     5

Chord: A - C - E = A MINOR (vi)
```

**Why minor?**
A to C = 3 half steps (minor 3rd)

---

**Chord viiÂ° (built on B - Leading Tone):**
```
C  D  E  F  G  A  B  C
                  1     3     5

Chord: B - D - F = B DIMINISHED (viiÂ°)
```

**Why diminished?**
- B to D = 3 half steps (minor 3rd)
- D to F = 3 half steps (minor 3rd)
- Both thirds are minor = diminished chord
- Symbol: Â° or dim

---

### The Diatonic Chord Pattern

**In ANY major key, the pattern is ALWAYS:**

```
I     = MAJOR
ii    = minor
iii   = minor
IV    = MAJOR
V     = MAJOR
vi    = minor
viiÂ°  = diminished
```

**This NEVER changes.**

**Memorize this pattern, and you know the chords in all 12 keys instantly.**

---

### Why Roman Numerals?

**Roman numerals show:**
1. **Scale degree** (which note the chord is built on)
2. **Chord quality** (major, minor, diminished)

**Uppercase = Major chord**
- I, IV, V

**Lowercase = Minor chord**
- ii, iii, vi

**Lowercase with Â° = Diminished chord**
- viiÂ°

**This system works in ALL keys.**

A song using "I-V-vi-IV" means:
- In C major: C-G-Am-F
- In G major: G-D-Em-C
- In D major: D-A-Bm-G

**Same progression, different keys, same Roman numerals.**

---

---

## 📖 SECTION 3: CHORD FAMILIES AND HARMONIC FUNCTION

### The Three Chord Families

**Diatonic chords organize into THREE functional families:**

---

**TONIC FAMILY (Home/Stability)**
- **I** (major) - Primary tonic, strongest resolution
- **iii** (minor) - Weak tonic substitute
- **vi** (minor) - Relative minor, tonic substitute

**Function:** Rest, resolution, stability, "home"  
**Feel:** Complete, settled, no tension

---

**SUBDOMINANT FAMILY (Pre-dominant/Movement Away)**
- **IV** (major) - Primary subdominant
- **ii** (minor) - Strong subdominant substitute

**Function:** Moves away from tonic, builds mild tension  
**Feel:** Moving, transitioning, not quite home

---

**DOMINANT FAMILY (Tension/Need to Resolve)**
- **V** (major) - Primary dominant, strongest tension
- **viiÂ°** (diminished) - Leading tone, pulls strongly to I

**Function:** Creates tension that must resolve to tonic  
**Feel:** Unstable, unfinished, needs resolution

---

### Why These Families Matter

**Understanding chord families explains WHY progressions work.**

**Strong Progression (Follows the Circle):**
```
I → IV → V → I
(Tonic → Subdominant → Dominant → Tonic)
(Home → Away → Tension → Home)

Result: Sounds complete, satisfying, resolved
```

**This is the most common progression in Western music** (I-IV-V-I).

---

**Weak Progression:**
```
I → iii → vi
(Tonic → Weak Tonic → Tonic Substitute)
(Home → Still Home → Still Home)

Result: Sounds static, no movement, no resolution
```

**No tension = No satisfaction when resolved.**

---

### The Circle of Harmonic Function

**Think of chord families as a cycle:**

```
TONIC (I, iii, vi)
    ↓
SUBDOMINANT (IV, ii)
    ↓
DOMINANT (V, viiÂ°)
    ↓
TONIC (I)
```

**Strong progressions follow this flow:**
- Start at tonic (I)
- Move through subdominant (IV)
- Create tension with dominant (V)
- Resolve back to tonic (I)

**This creates a complete musical "sentence" with beginning, middle, and end.**

---

## 📖 SECTION 4: COMMON CHORD PROGRESSIONS EXPLAINED

### I-IV-V-I: The Universal Progression

**Example in C Major: C - F - G - C**

**Roman Numerals: I - IV - V - I**

**Why it works:**
```
C (I)     = Tonic, home base
F (IV)    = Subdominant, moves away from home
G (V)     = Dominant, creates tension
C (I)     = Tonic, resolves back home
```

**This progression:**
- Establishes home (I)
- Leaves home (IV)
- Creates need to return (V)
- Returns home (I)

**Used in thousands of songs:**
- "Twist and Shout" - The Beatles
- "La Bamba" - Ritchie Valens
- "Louie Louie" - The Kingsmen
- "Wild Thing" - The Troggs

**It's universal because it follows natural harmonic function.**

---

### I-V-vi-IV: The Pop Progression

**Example in C Major: C - G - Am - F**

**Roman Numerals: I - V - vi - IV**

**Why it works:**
```
C (I)     = Tonic, home
G (V)     = Dominant, creates tension
Am (vi)   = Relative minor, soft resolution
F (IV)    = Subdominant, sets up return to I
```

**Used in countless hit songs:**
- "Let It Be" - The Beatles
- "Someone Like You" - Adele
- "Don't Stop Believin'" - Journey
- "With or Without You" - U2
- "I'm Yours" - Jason Mraz

**Why it's so popular:**
- Starts strong (I)
- Creates tension immediately (V)
- Resolves softly to vi (emotional)
- Sets up for repeat with IV

**The vi chord (relative minor) adds emotional depth.**

---

### I-vi-IV-V: The '50s Progression

**Example in C Major: C - Am - F - G**

**Roman Numerals: I - vi - IV - V**

**Why it works:**
```
C (I)     = Tonic, home
Am (vi)   = Relative minor, stays close to tonic
F (IV)    = Subdominant, moves away
G (V)     = Dominant, creates tension to resolve
```

**Used in classic songs:**
- "Stand By Me" - Ben E. King
- "Blue Moon" - The Marcels
- "Every Breath You Take" - The Police
- "Africa" - Toto

**Character:**
- Smooth start (I to vi is gentle)
- Builds gradually (IV adds movement)
- Strong resolution (V to I is powerful)

---

### I-IV-I-V: The Folk/Country Progression

**Example in G Major: G - C - G - D**

**Roman Numerals: I - IV - I - V**

**Why it works:**
```
G (I)     = Tonic, home
C (IV)    = Subdominant, brief departure
G (I)     = Tonic, returns home
D (V)     = Dominant, creates tension for next phrase
```

**Used in folk and country music:**
- "This Land Is Your Land" - Woody Guthrie
- "Take Me Home, Country Roads" - John Denver
- Countless traditional folk songs

**Character:**
- Very stable (returns to I quickly)
- Allows for storytelling
- V at end sets up next verse

---

### ii-V-I: The Jazz Progression

**Example in C Major: Dm - G - C**

**Roman Numerals: ii - V - I**

**Why it works:**
```
Dm (ii)   = Subdominant family, sets up motion
G (V)     = Dominant, creates strong tension
C (I)     = Tonic, strong resolution
```

**Why it's powerful:**
- ii → V is strong pre-dominant → dominant motion
- V → I is the strongest resolution in music
- **Used in jazz, classical, and sophisticated pop**

**Used constantly in jazz standards:**
- "Autumn Leaves"
- "Fly Me to the Moon"
- "All the Things You Are"

---

### vi-IV-I-V: The Emotional Progression

**Example in C Major: Am - F - C - G**

**Roman Numerals: vi - IV - I - V**

**Why it works:**
```
Am (vi)   = Relative minor, emotional start
F (IV)    = Subdominant, adds warmth
C (I)     = Tonic, brief resolution
G (V)     = Dominant, sets up repeat
```

**Character:**
- Starts with minor chord (emotional, introspective)
- Moves to major (brightens)
- Very singable, melodic progression

**Used in singer-songwriter music extensively.**

---

## 📖 SECTION 5: CHORD SUBSTITUTION WITHIN A KEY

### What Is Chord Substitution?

**Chord substitution:** Replacing one chord with another from the SAME chord family.

**Why substitute?**
- Add variety to familiar progressions
- Create different emotional colors
- Make songs more interesting on repeated sections

---

### Substitution Rules

**Rule 1: Substitute within the same family**

**Tonic Family Substitutions:**
- I ↔ iii (C major ↔ E minor in C major)
- I ↔ vi (C major ↔ A minor)
- iii ↔ vi (E minor ↔ A minor)

**Subdominant Family Substitutions:**
- IV ↔ ii (F major ↔ D minor in C major)

**Dominant Family Substitutions:**
- V ↔ viiÂ° (G major ↔ B diminished in C major)
- *Note: viiÂ° is less common, sounds more tense*

---

### Practical Substitution Examples

**Original: I-IV-V-I (C-F-G-C)**

**Substitute iii for I:**
- iii-IV-V-I (Em-F-G-C)
- Creates a more melancholic start

**Substitute ii for IV:**
- I-ii-V-I (C-Dm-G-C)
- Jazz sound, smoother voice leading

**Substitute vi for I:**
- vi-IV-V-I (Am-F-G-C)
- More emotional, common in ballads

---

**Original: I-V-vi-IV (C-G-Am-F)**

**Substitute iii for vi:**
- I-V-iii-IV (C-G-Em-F)
- Slightly less emotional, still beautiful

**Substitute ii for IV:**
- I-V-vi-ii (C-G-Am-Dm)
- More sophisticated, jazzy feel

---

### Advanced Substitution: Modal Interchange

**Modal interchange (borrowing):** Using chords from the PARALLEL minor key.

**In C Major, borrow from C Minor:**
- Borrow iv (F minor) instead of IV (F major)
- Borrow ♭VII (Bb major)
- Borrow ♭III (Eb major)

**Example:**
```
C - Fm - G - C
I - iv - V - I

The Fm (borrowed from C minor) adds darker color
```

**This creates unexpected emotional depth.**

**Note:** This is advanced. We'll cover it more in minor key lessons (Theory Module 2).
