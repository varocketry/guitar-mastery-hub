# Lesson 17: Power Chord Fundamentals & Root Movement

## Overview
**Focus**: Introduction to power chords, root note theory, and basic transitions  
**Duration**: 45-60 minutes  
**Goal**: Master the mechanics of power chords and understand their construction

---

## What You'll Learn Today
- Power chord construction (root + fifth)
- Proper finger placement and hand position
- Root notes on 6th and 5th strings
- Basic power chord transitions
- Palm muting technique with power chords

---

## Theory Foundation (10 minutes)

### What Are Power Chords?
Power chords are **two-note chords** consisting of:
- **Root note**: The foundation (gives the chord its name)
- **Fifth interval**: Two frets up, one string higher

**Why they're called "power" chords**:
- Strong, bold sound
- Neither major nor minor (no third)
- Perfect for rock, punk, and metal
- Easy to move around the fretboard




### Power Chord Anatomy

![E5 D5 A5 Power Chords](/chord_diagrams/e5-a5-d5_power_chords.png)

### Notation Explained
- **E5** = E power chord
- **A5** = A power chord
- **D5** = D power chord
- The "5" indicates it's a power chord (root + 5th)

---

## Warm-Up Routine (8 minutes)

### 1. Finger Independence Drill
**Purpose**: Prepare fingers for power chord shapes

```
Exercise on A and D strings:
A|--0--2--3--5--3--2--0--|
E|------------------------|

Then:
D|--0--2--3--5--3--2--0--|
A|------------------------|
```
- Play slowly with alternate picking
- Keep fingers hovering close to strings
- 2 minutes each string pair

### 2. String Skipping Preparation
```
Skip from 6th to 4th string:
e|------------------------
B|------------------------
G|------------------------
D|--0--2--0--2--0--2------
A|------------------------
E|--0--2--0--2--0--2------
```
- This mimics power chord movement
- 2 minutes

### 3. Finger Stretching
- Place index on 5th fret of E string
- Place ring finger on 7th fret of D string
- Hold for 10 seconds, release
- Repeat 5 times

## Technique Deep Dive (20 minutes)

### Part 1: 6th String Root Power Chords (10 minutes)

**Starting with E5 (Open Position)**

**Step 1**: Shape Formation

![E5 Power Chord](/chord_diagrams/e5_and_a5_powerchords.png)

**Finger placement:**
- Ring finger (or pinky): D string, 2nd fret
- Middle finger: A string, 2nd fret
- Open string: E string


**Hand Position Checklist**:
- [âœ“] Thumb behind neck (low position)
- [âœ“] Fingers curved, on fingertips
- [âœ“] Ring finger directly above middle finger
- [âœ“] Palm not touching neck
- [âœ“] Wrist straight, not bent

**Step 2**: Sound Check
1. Strum only the bottom 3 strings (E, A, D)
2. Listen for clean ring on all notes
3. If buzzing: press harder, check finger angles
4. **Mute the top 3 strings** with palm of strumming hand

**Step 3**: First Position - E5 and A5

![E5 Power Chord](/chord_diagrams/e5_and_a5_powerchords.png)

**Practice Routine** (5 minutes):
```
E5    A5    E5    A5
|  /  |  /  |  /  |  /  |

Count: 1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4
```
- 4 downstrokes per chord
- Count out loud
- Focus on clean transitions
- Tempo: 60 BPM

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
- [X] Strumming all 6 strings (creates muddy sound)
- [X] Lifting fingers too high between changes
- [X] Bending wrist excessively
- [X] Using flat finger pads instead of tips

### Part 2: Moving Up the Fretboard (10 minutes)

**F5 Power Chord** (1st fret)
```
e|---
B|---
G|---
D|--3 <- Ring finger
A|--3 <- Middle finger
E|--1 <- Index finger (barring root)
```

**The Barre Technique**:
- Index finger presses firmly on 1st fret, 6th string
- Middle and ring fingers stack on 3rd fret
- Keep index finger straight (not bent)

**Progression Exercise**:
```
E5 -> F5 -> G5 -> A5

Fret:  0    1    3    5
E|---0----1----3----5---
A|---2----3----5----7---
D|---2----3----5----7---
```

**Practice Pattern** (5 minutes):
1. **Slow Motion Transitions** (40 BPM)
   - Play E5 for 4 beats
   - Lift fingers, move to F5
   - Play F5 for 4 beats
   - Continue pattern

2. **Quarter Note Rhythm** (60 BPM)
   ```
   E5   F5   G5   A5
   |  /  |  /  |  /  |  /  |
   1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4
   ```

3. **Root Note Focus**:
   - Say the chord name as you play it
   - This reinforces root note awareness

## Palm Muting Technique (10 minutes)

### What is Palm Muting?
**Definition**: Resting the palm of your strumming hand lightly on the strings near the bridge to create a muted, percussive sound.

### Setting Up Palm Mute
**Hand Position**:
```
[Side of palm]
      |
======Bridge======
   |||||||
   Strings
```

1. Rest the **side of your palm** (pinky side) on strings
2. Position: **Right at the bridge** (where strings meet bridge)
3. Light pressure - don't press hard
4. Fingers still free to strum

### Testing Your Palm Mute
**Play E5 power chord**:
- Without palm mute: **CHUNG** (open, ringing)
- With palm mute: **chunk** (tight, controlled)

### Exercise 1: Mute Comparison
```
E5 (let ring)    E5 (palm mute)    E5 (let ring)    E5 (palm mute)
|  /  /  /  |    |  /  /  /  |    |  /  /  /  |    |  /  /  /  |
Open sound       chunk chunk       Open sound       chunk chunk
```

### Exercise 2: Power Chord + Palm Mute Combo
```
A5 (palm mute) - play 8 downstrokes
| / / / / / / / / |
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &

Rhythm: All eighth notes, all palm muted
```

**Listen for**: Tight, percussive "chunk-chunk-chunk" sound

### Exercise 3: Classic Rock Pattern
```
E5              A5              D5              A5
PM  PM  open    PM  PM  open    PM  PM  open    PM  PM  open
|   /   /   /   |   /   /   /   |   /   /   /   |   /   /   /
1   2   3   4   1   2   3   4   1   2   3   4   1   2   3   4
^   ^       ^   ^   ^       ^
Muted       Open
```

**Practice Steps**:
1. Start with just E5, practice mute pattern
2. Add chord changes when comfortable
3. Keep steady rhythm
4. Tempo: 80 BPM

## Musical Application (10 minutes)

### Song Fragment 1: "Blitzkrieg Bop" Style
**Ramones-inspired progression**

```
All palm muted power chords:

A5      D5      E5      D5
|/  /  /  /|/  /  /  /|/  /  /  /|/  /  /  /|

Strum: All downstrokes, eighth notes
Tempo: 160 BPM (start at 80 BPM)
Feel: Energetic, driving
```

### Song Fragment 2: "Smoke on the Water" Opening
**Deep Purple classic riff**

```
G5  Bb5  C5    G5  Bb5 Db5 C5    G5  Bb5  C5  Bb5  G5
|   /    /     |   /   /   /     |   /    /   /    /

Fret positions:
G5 = 3rd fret (6th string root)
Bb5 = 6th fret (5th string root)
C5 = 8th fret (5th string root)
Db5 = 9th fret (5th string root)
```

**Simplified Version for Today**:
```
Just play the opening phrase slowly:
G5    Bb5   C5
|  /    /     /   |

Count: 1   2     3
```

**Practice Method**:
1. Find G5 (3rd fret, 6th string root)
2. Move to Bb5 (1st fret, 5th string root)
3. Move to C5 (3rd fret, 5th string root)
4. Play each chord once, hold for 1 beat
5. Speed up gradually

### Song Fragment 3: Simple Punk Progression
```
E5    A5    D5    A5
|  /   |  /   |  /   |  /   |

Repeat 4 times
All downstrokes
Palm muted
Tempo: 120 BPM
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem: Buzzing Strings
**Causes**:
- Fingers not pressing hard enough
- Fingers not on proper angle
- Wrong finger placement

**Solutions**:
- Check finger position (on tips, not pads)
- Press with more finger strength
- Keep fingers perpendicular to fretboard
- Position fingers close to fret (behind the fret wire)

### Problem: Muted or Dead Sound
**Causes**:
- Fingers touching adjacent strings
- Not enough finger pressure
- Thumb position restricting fingers

**Solutions**:
- Arch fingers more
- Keep thumb lower on back of neck
- Check that fingers aren't flat against fretboard

### Problem: Can't Reach Power Chord Shape
**Causes**:
- Hand too small/fingers too short
- Incorrect finger assignment
- Wrist position wrong

**Solutions**:
- Use alternative fingering (index and ring instead of middle and ring)
- Start with lighter gauge strings
- Check thumb position - should be centered behind neck
- Practice finger stretching exercises daily

### Problem: Sloppy Transitions
**Causes**:
- Lifting fingers too high
- Moving fingers one at a time
- Tension in hand/arm

**Solutions**:
- Keep fingers hovering 1-2mm above strings
- Move entire shape as one unit
- Relax hand between chord changes
- Slow down tempo until smooth

### Problem: Palm Mute Too Heavy or Light
**Causes**:
- Palm too far forward or back on strings
- Too much or too little pressure
- Palm placement inconsistent

**Solutions**:
- Position palm right at bridge
- Use side of palm, not flat surface
- Practice "muted" vs "open" comparison
- Watch palm placement in mirror
