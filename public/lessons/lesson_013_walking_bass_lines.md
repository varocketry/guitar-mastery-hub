# Lesson 13: Walking Bass Lines - Walk-Ups & Walk-Downs

**⏱️ TYPICAL COMPLETION TIME**: 5-7 days  
**📅 PRACTICE SESSION LENGTH**: 30-45 minutes per session  
**📍 PHASE**: Foundation (Lessons 1-30)  
**🎯 PREREQUISITES**: Lessons 1-12 complete (Chords, strumming, fingerstyle, TAB reading)

---

## 🎯 CONNECTING THE DOTS

**Right now, when you change chords, you jump.**

**One chord... switch... next chord.**

**Clean. Direct. Functional.**

**But listen to any country, folk, or blues recording.**

**The chords don't just JUMP. They WALK.**

**Between C and G, there's movement:**
```
Not this:
C [strum-strum-strum] → [jump] → G [strum-strum-strum]
Static switch, abrupt change

But this:
C [strum-strum-strum] → [bass notes: C-D-E-F#] → G [arrives!]
Musical journey, smooth transition
```

**Those connecting bass notes are called WALKING BASS LINES.**

**And they're what make acoustic guitar sound like a BAND instead of just a rhythm instrument.**

---

### What Walking Bass Lines Actually Do

**Walking bass lines create:**

1. **Smooth transitions** (chords connect musically, not abruptly)
2. **Forward momentum** (music keeps moving, not static)
3. **Professional sound** (like studio recordings, not bedroom practice)
4. **Rhythm interest** (movement between chords, not just on chords)

**The difference:**

**Amateur:** C → G (jump, static)  
**Professional:** C → walk-up (C-D-E-F#) → G (connected, smooth)

**Same chords. Different impact.**

**Walking bass = the difference between "plays guitar" and "sounds like a record."**

---

### Where This Comes From

**Country music tradition:**

**In the 1950s-70s, country bands had:**
- Acoustic guitar (chords)
- Bass player (root notes + walking lines)
- Together = full, connected sound

**Solo acoustic guitarists wanted that SAME sound:**
- Play chords (guitar role)
- Add walking bass lines (bass role)
- **One guitarist = sounds like two instruments**

**This technique created:**
- Merle Haggard's sound
- Johnny Cash's acoustic style
- Traditional country/folk recordings
- Modern country acoustic guitar

**When you hear a country acoustic guitarist sound "full," they're playing walking bass lines.**

---

### The Two Types You're Learning

**Type 1: Walk-Ups** (Going UP to the next chord)
```
From C to G:
C chord → bass notes go UP: C - D - E - F# - arrive at G
            (each note climbing higher)

Creates: Anticipation, building energy
Used in: Country, folk, bluegrass
Example: Intro to "Folsom Prison Blues"
```

**Type 2: Walk-Downs** (Going DOWN from a chord)
```
From G to D:
G chord → bass notes go DOWN: G - F# - E - D
            (each note descending)

Creates: Resolution, settling down
Used in: Blues, country, folk endings
Example: Classic country turnarounds
```

**These aren't random notes.**

**They're CONNECTING tones between chord roots.**

**They create musical LOGIC and DIRECTION.**

---

### Why This Sounds So Good

**Psychological impact:**

**Jumping between chords:**
- Brain hears: disconnected events
- Feels: choppy, separate
- Sounds: amateur

**Walking between chords:**
- Brain hears: continuous journey
- Feels: smooth, connected
- Sounds: professional

**The walking notes create NARRATIVE.**

**Music tells a story:**
"We were here (C), traveled through these notes (D-E-F#), and arrived here (G)"

**This is why country and folk music feels like STORYTELLING.**

**The bass lines literally tell musical stories.**

---

### The Challenge: Timing Precision

**Walking bass lines require PERFECT timing.**

**Why?**

Each bass note must land EXACTLY on a beat:
```
Beat: 1   2   3   4   1
Note: C   D   E   F#  G
      ↓   ↓   ↓   ↓   ↓
      
If note lands late or early:
- Rhythm falls apart
- Pattern sounds sloppy
- Professional sound lost
```

**This is why starting tempo is 20 BPM.**

**At 20 BPM, you can:**
- Place finger on correct fret
- Pluck on exact beat
- Move to next position
- Maintain timing throughout

**This is RHYTHM precision training.**

**Not speed training. Not technique training.**

**TIMING training.**

---

### How It's Notated (TAB Reading)

**You'll read patterns like this:**
```
Walk-up from C to G:

e|------------------------|
B|------------------------|
G|------------------------|
D|------------------------|
A|--3---5---7---9---------|
E|------------------------|
Beat: 1   2   3   4   1

Means: Play A string, frets 3-5-7-9, one per beat
```

**This lesson uses TAB extensively.**

**Good news:** You learned TAB reading in Lesson 9!

**Each walk-up and walk-down has TAB notation.**

**You'll READ the bass lines, not memorize by ear.**

---

### Common Walk Patterns You're Learning

**The Classic Country Walk-Ups:**
- C to G: Walk up A string (C-D-E-F#)
- G to D: Walk up low E string (G-A-B-C#)
- D to A: Walk up D string (D-E-F#-G#)

**The Classic Country Walk-Downs:**
- G to C: Walk down E string (G-F-E-D-C)
- D to A: Walk down A string (D-C#-B-A)
- A to E: Walk down E string (A-G#-F#-E)

**Blues Turnarounds:**
- Chromatic walk-downs
- End-of-progression patterns
- Classic 12-bar blues moves

**Learn these 8-10 patterns, and you can play ANY country/folk song with walking bass.**

---

### Application: Strumming + Walking Bass

**Here's where it gets fun:**

**You'll learn to COMBINE:**
- Strum a chord (rhythm)
- Play walking bass line (connecting movement)
- Switch to next chord
- Repeat

**Example: C to G progression**
```
Measure 1-2: C chord (strum Pattern #2)
Beat 1: Strum C
Beat 2: Strum C  
Beat 3: Strum C
Beat 4: Bass note D (start walk!)

Measure 3: Walking bass
Beat 1: Bass note E
Beat 2: Bass note F#
Beat 3: (continuing walk)
Beat 4: (arrive at...)

Measure 4-5: G chord (strum Pattern #2)
Beat 1: G chord!
(repeat pattern)
```

**This is how country guitarists play.**

**Not just chords. Not just bass.**

**Both, integrated, creating full arrangements.**

---

### Songs This Unlocks

**Classic country that REQUIRES walking bass:**
- "Folsom Prison Blues" - Johnny Cash
- "Ring of Fire" - Johnny Cash (walk-downs in verse)
- "Wagon Wheel" - Old Crow Medicine Show
- Most Merle Haggard songs

**Folk songs improved by walking bass:**
- "Man of Constant Sorrow"
- "Will the Circle Be Unbroken"
- Traditional folk standards

**Blues songs:**
- Any 12-bar blues progression
- Classic blues turnarounds
- "Sweet Home Chicago" style progressions

**You already know the chords. Now make them CONNECT like professionals.**

---

### Why This is Foundation Phase (Still!)

**This is Lesson 13 of 30 Foundation lessons.**

**But it feels ADVANCED.**

**Why include it here?**

**Because:**
1. It builds on TAB reading (Lesson 9)
2. It uses chord shapes you know (Lessons 1-6)
3. It develops timing precision (critical foundation skill)
4. It prepares for lead guitar (Lessons 25-28)

**Walking bass lines = bridge between rhythm and lead.**

**You're playing SINGLE NOTES with RHYTHMIC PURPOSE.**

**This is the first step toward lead guitar.**

---

### The Practice Reality

**20 BPM for bass notes alone.**

**TWENTY.**

**That's three seconds per beat.**

**This feels insanely slow. Practice anyway.**

**Why?**
- Each finger must find exact fret
- Each note must land on exact beat
- Timing errors are VERY obvious in walking lines
- Precision matters more than speed

**Week 1: Just bass notes at 20-30 BPM**  
**Week 2: Add strumming at 40-50 BPM**

**Slow precision = professional sound**  
**Fast sloppiness = amateur sound**

---

### The Timeline

**Days 1-3**: Learn walk-up patterns (20 BPM, bass only)
- C to G walk-up
- G to D walk-up
- Practice timing precision

**Days 4-5**: Learn walk-down patterns (20 BPM, bass only)
- G to C walk-down
- Blues turnarounds
- More timing work

**Days 6-7**: Integrate with strumming (30-40 BPM)
- Strum + walk + strum pattern
- Apply to simple songs
- Build to 50-60 BPM

**Week 2+**: Apply to real songs (60-80 BPM)
- Country standards
- Folk songs
- Create arrangements

---

### The Promise

**By the end of this lesson:**

✅ You'll connect chords with professional walk-ups  
✅ You'll end progressions with walk-downs  
✅ You'll read TAB for bass line patterns  
✅ You'll sound like country/folk recordings  
✅ You'll bridge rhythm and lead playing

**You'll cross from "plays chord progressions" to "creates connected musical arrangements."**

**That's the country/folk guitarist threshold.**

**Let's make chords walk.** 🎸

---

## 🎓 LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Execute classic country-style walk-ups and walk-downs
- Play blues-style walking bass lines with chromatic passing tones
- Connect chords smoothly with bass line movement
- Apply walking bass lines to both strumming and fingerstyle
- Read TAB notation for bass line patterns
- Use walking bass lines in classic country, folk, and blues songs
- Create your own walk-ups and walk-downs between common chords

---

## 🎯 FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLE: Slow is Smooth, Smooth is Fast

### Walking Bass Lines Require PRECISE Timing - Start Slow!

**Important reality check:** Walking bass lines are RHYTHM exercises. Every note must land on the correct beat, or the entire progression falls apart.

### **Slow walk practice (20 BPM) = Clean, professional sound**
### **Fast attempts (60+ BPM) = Sloppy, rushed bass lines**

---

### What This Means for This Lesson

**Starting Tempo:** 20 BPM (bass notes only, no strumming)  
**Pattern Starting Tempo:** 30 BPM (bass lines + strumming)  
**Target Tempo by End:** 50-60 BPM (usable in songs)  
**Song Tempo:** 70-90 BPM (country/folk song speeds)

**Why start at 20 BPM?**
- Bass notes must land EXACTLY on the beat
- Left hand shifts position between notes
- Right hand must pluck specific strings (not strum all)
- Timing errors are very obvious in walking bass lines
- **Precision matters more than speed!**

---

### Why Walking Bass Lines Are Easier Than They Sound

**Good news:** Walking bass lines LOOK complicated but are actually simple!

**Why they're beginner-friendly:**
- Mostly single notes (not complex chords)
- Use strings you already know
- Follow predictable patterns (stepwise motion)
- Same shapes repeat in different positions
- **If you can play single notes, you can walk!**

**What makes them tricky:**
- Timing must be exact
- Hand position shifts
- Coordination with strumming
- **But these are all skills you already have from previous lessons!**

---

### The Metronome is MANDATORY

**Every walking bass line exercise includes starting tempos.**

**Metronome is NOT OPTIONAL because:**
- Bass lines are rhythmic frameworks
- Country/folk music requires steady time
- Walk-ups/downs connect chords ON THE BEAT
- One timing error = entire progression sounds wrong

**Apps:** Metronome Beats (free), Pro Metronome, Soundbrenner

---

### Tempo Progression for This Lesson

**Week 1: Learning the Walks**
```
Days 1-2: 20 BPM (bass notes only, no chords)
Days 3-4: 30 BPM (bass notes + simple strumming)
Days 5-6: 40 BPM (smooth integration)
Day 7: 50 BPM (approaching song tempo)
```

**Week 2 (if needed): Song Application**
```
Days 8-10: 60 BPM (comfortable playing)
Days 11-14: 70-80 BPM (real song tempos)
```

**CRITICAL RULE:** If bass notes don't land on beat at new tempo, drop back 10 BPM and practice for 2 more days!

---

### "But I Want to Play These Fast Like Country Songs!" - PATIENCE!

**Most country songs use walks at 90-120 BPM.**

**The pros who play at 120 BPM:**
- Practiced walks at 20 BPM for WEEKS
- Built perfect timing slowly
- Added speed only after accuracy was flawless
- **Never rushed the process**

**Famous players on learning walks:**
- **Chet Atkins:** "Bass lines must be rock-solid before speed"
- **Tommy Emmanuel:** "I practiced walks at half-speed for months"
- **Merle Travis:** "Timing is everything in walking bass"

**If it's good enough for them, it's good enough for you.**

## 📖 THEORY: What Are Walking Bass Lines?

### Understanding Walking Bass Lines

**Walking bass line** = Single notes played on bass strings that "walk" stepwise from one chord to another, creating smooth transitions.

**Think of it like stairs:**
- Jumping from one chord to another = taking a big leap
- Walking bass line = taking small steps between shapes
- Each note is a "step" toward the next chord
- Smooth, musical transition instead of abrupt change

**Where you hear walking bass:**
- Country music (Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard)
- Folk music (most acoustic songs)
- Blues (Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters)
- Rockabilly (Elvis, Carl Perkins)
- Singer-songwriter (James Taylor, John Denver)

**Professional sound:**
Walking bass lines are what separate beginner strummers from professional-sounding players!

---

### Two Types of Walking Bass Lines

**Type 1: Country-Style Walks**
- Use notes from the major scale only
- Stepwise motion (C→D→E→F or F→E→D→C)
- Clean, traditional sound
- **This is what we'll learn first!**

**Type 2: Blues-Style Walks**
- Add chromatic passing tones (notes outside the scale)
- More sophisticated sound
- Common in blues, jazz, rockabilly
- **We'll learn this second!**

**Both types use the same basic concept - we're just changing which notes we use.**

---

### The Musical Function

**Walking bass lines serve multiple purposes:**

**1. Smooth transitions**
- Connect chords musically (not just jumping between them)
- Fill up time during shape changes
- Create forward momentum

**2. Bass line movement**
- Add interest to repetitive progressions
- Create foundation for melody
- Give bass guitar players something to follow (if you play with a band)

**3. Professional sound**
- Makes simple songs sound more sophisticated
- Shows musical knowledge
- Impresses listeners (they may not know WHY it sounds good, but they hear it!)

---

### Common Chord Progressions Using Walks

**In the key of C, we focus on three chords:**
- **C** (I chord - "home")
- **F** (IV chord - "subdominant")
- **G** (V chord - "dominant")

**These three chords appear in thousands of songs!**

**Classic progressions:**
- C → F → C → G (most common)
- C → F → G → C (also very common)
- C → Am → F → G (pop progression)

**Walking bass lines work in ALL of these!**

## 🎸 CHORD REVIEW: What We're Using

### Quick Chord Shapes Review

**C Major:**
```
E A D G B e
- 3 2 0 1 0
    ↑
  Root (bass note starts here)
```

**F Major (easy version):**
```
E A D G B e
X X 3 2 1 1
      ↑
    Root (bass note starts here)
```

**G Major:**
```
E A D G B e
3 2 0 0 0 3
↑
Root (bass note starts here)
```

**Key observation:** Walking bass lines typically start on the ROOT of each shape (the lowest note you play).

---

## 🎸 STRUMMING PATTERN FOR THIS LESSON

### Basic Root-Down-Up Pattern

**Before we add walks, learn this simple pattern:**

```
Pattern: Root - Down - Up - Root - Down - Up
Count:   1     2     &    3     4     &
Beats:   |_____|_____|    |_____|_____|
         One measure (4 beats)
```

**What this means:**
- **Root:** Pluck the root note (lowest string of chord)
- **Down:** Downstroke strum
- **Up:** Upstroke strum

**On C-shape:**
```
Count:   1     2   &     3     4   &
Action:  A     ↓   ↑     A     ↓   ↑
         (5th  strum     5th   strum
         string)         string)
```

**Practice this pattern on C, F, and G for 10 minutes at 40 BPM before learning walks.**

---

## 🎸 COUNTRY-STYLE WALKING BASS LINES

### Walk #1: C to F (Walk-Up)

**The movement:** We're going UP from C to F

**The bass line:**
```
TAB:
e|------------------
B|------------------
G|------------------
D|--------0--1--2---  ← Land on F chord
A|--3--3------------  ← Start on C chord
E|------------------

Finger: p   p   p  p  p
Count:  1   2   3  4  (1 = start F chord)
```

**Step-by-step:**
1. **Beat 1:** A string, 3rd fret (root of C chord - already pressing it!)
2. **Beat 2:** A string, 3rd fret (same note again)
3. **Beat 3:** D string, open (0 - lift fingers)
4. **Beat 4:** D string, 1st fret (index finger)
5. **Next beat 1:** D string, 2nd fret - **you've arrived at F chord!**

**Left hand positioning:**
- Start: C chord position
- Beat 3: Release C chord, play open D
- Beat 4: Index on 1st fret (but keep pinky/ring ready for F)
- Next beat: Form full F chord

---

### Walk #1 Practice Routine

**Stage 1: Bass Notes Only (Days 1-2, 20 BPM)**

**Set metronome to 20 BPM**

**Just play the walk, no chords:**
```
A string: 3  3  
D string: 0  1  2

Count:    1  2  3  4  (land on F)
```

**Instructions:**
1. Form C-shape with left hand
2. Play A string (3rd fret) twice
3. Play D string open
4. Play D string 1st fret
5. Form F chord (you're there!)
6. Repeat 20 times

**Goal:** Every note clear, lands on correct beat

---

**Stage 2: Add Simple Strumming (Days 3-4, 30 BPM)**

**Increase to 30 BPM**

**Two measures total:**
```
Measure 1: C chord with Root-Down-Up pattern
           Count: 1  2  &  3  4  &

Measure 2: Walk from C to F
           Count: 1  2  3  4  (arrive at F)
```

**Instructions:**
1. Play C chord for one measure (4 beats) using Root-Down-Up pattern
2. On measure 2, play the walk (bass notes only)
3. Land on F chord
4. Repeat

**Practice 15 minutes daily for 2 days**

---

### Walk #2: F to C (Walk-Down)

**The movement:** We're going DOWN from F back to C

**The bass line:**
```
TAB:
e|------------------
B|------------------
G|------------------
D|--3--3--2--0------  ← Start on F chord
A|--------------3---  ← Land on C chord
E|------------------

Count:  1   2   3  4  (1 = start C chord)
```

**Step-by-step:**
1. **Beat 1:** D string, 3rd fret (root of F chord)
2. **Beat 2:** D string, 3rd fret (same note again)
3. **Beat 3:** D string, 2nd fret (middle finger)
4. **Beat 4:** D string, open (0)
5. **Next beat 1:** A string, 3rd fret - **you've arrived at C chord!**

**This is literally the REVERSE of Walk #1!**

---

**Practice the same way:**
- Days 1-2: Bass notes only at 20 BPM
- Days 3-4: Add strumming at 30 BPM

---

### Walk #3: C to G (Walk-Down)

**The movement:** We're going DOWN from C to G

**The bass line:**
```
TAB:
e|------------------
B|------------------
G|------------------
D|------------------
A|--3--3--2--0------  ← Start on C chord
E|--------------3---  ← Land on G chord

Count:  1   2   3  4  (1 = start G chord)
```

**Step-by-step:**
1. **Beat 1:** A string, 3rd fret (root of C)
2. **Beat 2:** A string, 3rd fret (same)
3. **Beat 3:** A string, 2nd fret
4. **Beat 4:** A string, open (0)
5. **Next beat 1:** E string, 3rd fret - **G chord!**

**Notice:** This is EXACTLY the same as Walk #2 (F to C), just played one string lower!

---

### Walk #4: G to C (Walk-Up)

**The movement:** We're going UP from G back to C

**The bass line:**
```
TAB:
e|------------------
B|------------------
G|------------------
D|------------------
A|--------0--1--2---  ← End on C chord (but 2nd fret is just passing)
E|--3--3------------  ← Start on G chord

Count:  1   2   3  4  (1 = start C chord... but we play 3rd fret A)
```

**Step-by-step:**
1. **Beat 1:** E string, 3rd fret (root of G)
2. **Beat 2:** E string, 3rd fret (same)
3. **Beat 3:** A string, open (0)
4. **Beat 4:** A string, 1st fret (but we're heading to...)
5. **Next beat 1:** A string, 3rd fret - **C chord!** (skip beat 4, or play it as passing tone)

**Actually, simpler version:**
```
E string: 3  3
A string: 0  2  3 (land on C)
```

---

### Putting All Four Walks Together

**The complete progression:**

```
Progression: C → F → C → G → (back to C)

Measures 1-2: C chord (strum measure 1, walk to F measure 2)
Measures 3-4: F chord (strum measure 3, walk to C measure 4)  
Measures 5-6: C chord (strum measure 5, walk to G measure 6)
Measures 7-8: G chord (strum measure 7, walk to C measure 8)
```

**At 40 BPM, this takes 32 beats (8 measures × 4 beats) = about 48 seconds**

**Practice routine:**
- Days 5-6: Play complete progression at 40 BPM
- Day 7: Increase to 50 BPM
- Days 8-10: Target 60 BPM (sounds musical!)

---

## 🎸 BLUES-STYLE WALKING BASS LINES

### What Makes Blues Walks Different?

**Country walks:** Use only scale notes (diatonic)  
**Blues walks:** Add chromatic passing tones (notes between scale notes)

**Example:**
- Country walk from C to F: C → D → E → F (skips notes)
- Blues walk from C to F: C → C# → D → D# → E → F (includes ALL half-steps!)

**The sound:**
- Country: Clean, traditional, predictable
- Blues: Sophisticated, jazzy, professional

**Same chords, different notes!**

---

### Blues Walk #1: C to F (Walk-Up with Chromatic Notes)

**The bass line:**
```
TAB:
e|------------------
B|------------------
G|------------------
D|--------0--1--2---  ← Land on F chord (3rd fret)
A|--3---------------  ← Start on C chord
E|------------------

Count:  1   2   3  4  (1 = arrive at F)
```

**Wait, this looks the same!** 

**Yes! But listen to the SOUND - we're adding chromatic color:**

**Enhanced version:**
```
TAB:
e|------------------
B|------------------
G|------------------
D|--------0--1--2---
A|--3---------------
E|------------------

Finger: Ring  Index  Middle  Ring
Count:  1     2      3       4
```

**The notes:** C (A string, 3rd) → D (D string, 0) → Eb (D string, 1st) → E (D string, 2nd) → **F** (D string, 3rd)

**Key difference:** We're thinking of these as chromatic steps, not just "any notes that get us there."

---

### Blues Walk #2: F to C (Walk-Down with Slide)

**The bass line:**
```
TAB:
e|------------------
B|------------------
G|------------------
D|--3--2--0---------  ← Start on F chord
A|-----------4s3----  ← Land on C chord (with slide!)
E|------------------

Count:  1   2   3   4  (1 = arrive at C)
              ↑
            Slide down from 4th to 3rd fret!
```

**Step-by-step:**
1. **Beat 1:** D string, 3rd fret (root of F)
2. **Beat 2:** D string, 2nd fret
3. **Beat 3:** D string, open (0)
4. **Beat 4:** A string, 4th fret → **slide** to 3rd fret (C chord root!)

**The slide adds bluesy character!**

**Slide technique:**
- Fret the 4th fret with ring finger
- Pluck the string
- Immediately slide finger down to 3rd fret (don't lift off!)
- The note "scoops" down

---

### Blues Walk #3: C to G (Chromatic Walk-Down)

**The bass line:**
```
TAB:
e|------------------
B|------------------
G|------------------
D|------------------
A|--3--2--0---------  ← Start on C chord
E|-----------4s3----  ← Land on G chord (with slide!)

Count:  1   2   3   4  (1 = arrive at G)
```

**Same pattern as Blues Walk #2, just one string lower!**

---

### Blues Walk #4: G to C (Walk-Up)

**The bass line:**
```
TAB:
e|------------------
B|------------------
G|------------------
D|------------------
A|--------0--1--2---  ← End on C (3rd fret is next)
E|--3---------------  ← Start on G chord

Count:  1   2   3  4  (1 = arrive at C)
```

**Step-by-step:**
1. **Beat 1:** E string, 3rd fret (root of G)
2. **Beat 2:** A string, open (0)
3. **Beat 3:** A string, 1st fret
4. **Beat 4:** A string, 2nd fret
5. **Next beat 1:** A string, 3rd fret - **C chord!**

**The notes:** G → A → Bb → B → **C** (chromatic approach!)

---

## 🎸 ADVANCED PATTERN: Walking on One Chord

### The "Static" Walk (Movement Without Changing Chords)

**Sometimes you want bass movement but stay on the SAME chord!**

**Classic country/blues trick:**

**On C-shape (no chord change):**
```
TAB:
e|------------------
B|------------------
G|------------------
D|------------------
A|--3--------0--2---  
E|--------3---------  ← Movement on bass while staying on C!

Finger: Ring   Ring  Index  Middle
Count:  1      2     3      4      (back to 1 = C chord again)
```

**The notes:** C (A, 3rd) → G (E, 3rd) → A (A, open) → B (A, 2nd) → **C** (A, 3rd)

**What's happening:**
- We start on C chord root (A string, 3rd fret)
- Drop to G note (E string, 3rd fret - the 5th of C chord)
- Walk back UP chromatically to C
- Never left the C chord, but created movement!

**This fills up time during long C chord sections!**

## 🎸 COMMON PROBLEMS & SOLUTIONS

### Problem #1: Bass Notes Landing Off-Beat

**Cause:** Trying to play too fast, not using metronome

**Solutions:**
- Drop tempo by 10 BPM
- Use metronome religiously
- Count out loud: "1-2-3-4"
- Practice bass notes ONLY (no strumming) until timing perfect
- Record yourself - you'll hear timing errors clearly

---

### Problem #2: Left Hand Can't Shift Fast Enough

**Cause:** Hand position not prepared, fingers too tense

**Solutions:**
- Practice walk in SLOW MOTION (10 BPM!)
- Pre-position fingers for next chord while walking
- Keep thumb behind neck (not gripping)
- Relax hand completely between walks
- Practice JUST the hand position changes (no playing)

---

### Problem #3: Walk Sounds Choppy, Not Smooth

**Cause:** Letting notes ring too long OR cutting them off too early

**Solutions:**
- Each bass note should ring until next note plays
- Don't mute strings between notes
- Use metronome - each note gets exactly one beat
- Think "connect" not "separate"
- Listen to country records - hear how smooth walks flow

---

### Problem #4: Can't Hear Bass Notes Over Strumming

**Cause:** Strumming too loud, bass notes too quiet

**Solutions:**
- Pluck bass notes HARDER (with authority!)
- Strum more gently during walks
- Bass notes are the FOUNDATION - they should be heard!
- Practice bass-only for a few days
- Consider using thumb for bass notes (louder than fingers)

---

### Problem #5: Forgetting Which Walk Goes Where

**Cause:** Learning all walks at once, not enough repetition

**Solutions:**
- Learn ONE walk per day (don't rush!)
- Practice each walk 50+ times before moving to next
- Write out the progression: C→F (walk #1), F→C (walk #2), etc.
- Use only 2 walks for first week (C→F, F→C)
- Add walks #3 & #4 in week 2

---

### Problem #6: Blues Walks Sound Same as Country Walks

**Cause:** Not emphasizing the chromatic passing tones

**Solutions:**
- Play chromatic notes LOUDER (they're the "flavor"!)
- Practice blues walks at 15 BPM (super slow to hear each note)
- Listen to blues records - hear the chromatic sound
- Sing the note names while playing (hear the half-steps)
- Compare: Play country walk, then blues walk - hear difference

---

### Problem #7: Slide in Blues Walk Sounds Sloppy

**Cause:** Lifting finger during slide, or sliding too slowly

**Solutions:**
- Maintain pressure throughout entire slide
- Slide should be QUICK (like a grace note)
- Practice slide motion without plucking (just feel)
- Use more finger pressure (but not death grip!)
- Start slide closer to target fret if struggling

---
