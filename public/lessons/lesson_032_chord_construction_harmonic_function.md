# Lesson 32: Chord Construction & Harmonic Function - Creating Music

## 🎯 THE COMPOSER: From Understanding to Creating

**You understand music theory fundamentals. You know the language.**

But here's what separates the **theorist** from the **composer**:

**Theorist thinking:** "I can explain why this progression works."  
**Composer thinking:** "I can create progressions that work—because I understand the principles."

**The difference?** One analyzes. The other **creates**.

---

### The Moment Theory Becomes Music

Every composer remembers when theory transformed from concepts to creative power:

**Brian Eno:** *"When I learned how to construct chords from scale degrees—that I could build any chord by stacking thirds from any scale note—it was revolutionary. I wasn't limited to the chords I'd been shown. I could create ANY chord I could imagine. Theory didn't teach me what to play. It taught me how to create what I heard in my mind."*

**The transformation:**
- Not memorizing chord shapes
- Not limited to "common progressions"
- Understanding the **architecture of harmony**
- **Building any musical structure you imagine**

---

**Leonard Cohen:** *"I learned three chords and wrote hundreds of songs with them. Then I learned theory—how chords function, how to build progressions—and suddenly those three chords became thirty. Not because I learned new shapes. Because I understood how to use what I already knew in infinite combinations. Theory multiplied my creative possibilities by ten."*

---

### The Three Revelations About Chord Theory

**Revelation 1: All Chords Follow the Same Construction Logic**

**Norah Jones:** *"When I learned that EVERY chord—every major, minor, 7th, 9th, 13th—is built the same way (stacking intervals from a scale), it blew my mind. There's no mystery. C major? It's the 1st, 3rd, and 5th of C major scale. C minor? Same, but with a flatted 3rd. Cmaj7? Add the 7th. Every chord follows this logic. Once you know the formula, you can build any chord."*

**The universal formula:**
- Pick a root note
- Choose a scale (major or minor)
- Stack the intervals you want (3rd, 5th, 7th, etc.)
- **That's ANY chord, explained**

---

**Revelation 2: Progressions Aren't Random—They Follow Functional Patterns**

**John Legend:** *"Why does I-V-vi-IV work in a thousand pop songs? Because it follows functional harmony. I (home) â†' V (tension) â†' vi (minor contrast) â†' IV (pre-dominant) â†' back to I (resolution). It's not magic. It's harmonic function. Once you understand function, you can create progressions that work every time."*

**The truth about "good progressions":**
- Not: Certain chords just "sound good" together
- But: Chords have functional relationships
- Not: Memorize common progressions
- But: Understand why they work, create your own
- **Function > Memorization**

---

**Revelation 3: You Already Use This Theory Every Time You Play**

**Adele:** *"People say 'I don't know theory.' Then they play a song. I ask: 'Why did you play C, then F, then G?' They say: 'It sounds right.' That IS theory. You're hearing functional relationships. You just don't know what to call them. Theory doesn't teach you what sounds right—you already know that. Theory explains why it sounds right."*

**Every time you play:**
- Choosing chords that "sound right" = understanding harmony (intuitively)
- Resolution feeling "complete" = tonic function
- Certain chords creating "tension" = dominant function
- **You're already using theory—now you'll understand it consciously**

---

### Why This Completes Your Education

**Lesson 31 taught the alphabet (scales, intervals).**  
**Lesson 32 teaches sentence structure (chords, progressions).**

**The transformation:**
- From knowing notes → building chords
- From understanding intervals → creating progressions
- From theory concepts → musical composition
- From analyzing music → creating music
- **From student → composer**

**Randy Newman:** *"Music theory for songwriters isn't about analyzing Bach. It's about: 'I hear a chord in my head—how do I build it?' 'I want to create tension—which chord creates that?' 'I need resolution—which progression gives me that?' Theory is practical. It's the toolbox for creation."*

### The Reality About This Lesson

**What makes chord theory challenging:**
- Abstract thinking (building chords conceptually)
- Multiple concepts integrating (scales + intervals + function)
- Application to fretboard (finding chords you've built)
- Creative decision-making (which chords to use)

**What makes it achievable:**
- Builds on Lesson 31 (you have the foundation)
- Uses chords you already play (practical application)
- Explains what you already hear (making conscious the unconscious)
- Immediately applicable (create music right away)

**Danny Elfman:** *"Chord theory seems complicated until you realize: it's just patterns. Same patterns used in every song ever written. Once you see the patterns, you see them everywhere. Then you use them yourself. It's pattern recognition, not rocket science."*

---

### The Timeline Reality

**This isn't "understand in one reading" material.**

**Realistic timeline:**
- Week 1-2: Chord construction (building triads and 7ths)
- Week 3-4: Harmonic function (understanding progressions)
- Week 5-8: Practical application (creating your own)
- **Total: 6-8 weeks for deep understanding**

**Why this long?**
- Conceptual understanding (not physical practice)
- Must internalize through application
- Creative use takes experimentation
- Understanding deepens with use

**But once internalized, you have it forever.**

---

### What You'll Unlock

**After mastering chord theory:**
- Build any chord you hear in your mind
- Create progressions that sound "right"
- Understand any chord chart instantly
- Substitute chords creatively (variations on progressions)
- Analyze songs (understand why they work)
- Write original music (with harmonic sophistication)
- **Complete creative freedom**

**Jacob Collier:** *"When people hear my harmony and ask 'how do you think of that?' The answer is: theory. I hear a sound in my mind. I know how intervals create that sound. I build the chord. I know how it functions. I place it in a progression. Theory isn't limiting my creativity—it's enabling me to create exactly what I imagine. That's freedom."*

---

### The Permission You Need

**You might think:**

"Chord theory is too advanced for me."  
"I'm not smart enough for this level."  
"This is for jazz musicians, not regular players."  
"I don't need this—I can already play songs."

**Here's the truth:**

**You've mastered 30 lessons—this is easier** (conceptual, not technical)  
**You're absolutely smart enough** (proven by getting this far)  
**This is for ALL musicians** (pop, rock, folk—everyone uses this)  
**You can play songs—now create your own** (unlimited potential)

**Paul Simon:** *"I'm not a jazz musician. I write folk-pop songs. Three-minute songs with verse-chorus-bridge. But I use advanced harmonic theory in every song. Not to show off—to create the exact emotional effect I want. Theory isn't for one genre. It's for anyone who wants their music to be intentional, not accidental."*

---

### One Critical Truth

**Every great songwriter uses this theory.**  
**Every memorable progression follows these principles.**  
**Every song you love proves this works.**

**You're not learning abstract concepts.**  
**You're learning the architecture of your favorite music.**

## 🎵 SECTION 1: BUILDING TRIADS

### What Is a Triad?

**Triad:** A three-note chord built by stacking thirds.

**Formula:** Root + 3rd + 5th (from a scale)

**Example: C Major Triad**
```
C Major Scale: C - D - E - F - G - A - B
Pick every other note: C (1) - E (3) - G (5)
Result: C Major Chord
```

**This is how ALL triads are built.**

---

### The Four Triad Types

**1. Major Triad**
- **Formula:** 1 - 3 - 5 (from major scale)
- **Sound:** Happy, bright, stable
- **Example:** C Major = C - E - G
- **Half steps:** Root, +4 half steps, +3 half steps

**2. Minor Triad**
- **Formula:** 1 - ♭3 - 5 (flatted 3rd)
- **Sound:** Sad, dark, stable
- **Example:** C Minor = C - E♭ - G
- **Half steps:** Root, +3 half steps, +4 half steps

**3. Diminished Triad**
- **Formula:** 1 - ♭3 - ♭5 (flatted 3rd and 5th)
- **Sound:** Tense, unstable, unresolved
- **Example:** C Diminished = C - E♭ - G♭
- **Half steps:** Root, +3 half steps, +3 half steps

**4. Augmented Triad**
- **Formula:** 1 - 3 - #5 (sharped 5th)
- **Sound:** Bright, tense, unusual
- **Example:** C Augmented = C - E - G#
- **Half steps:** Root, +4 half steps, +4 half steps

---

### The Key Difference: Major vs. Minor

**The only difference is ONE NOTE—the 3rd.**

**C Major:** C - E - G (major 3rd = 4 half steps from root)  
**C Minor:** C - E♭ - G (minor 3rd = 3 half steps from root)

**That one half-step changes the entire emotional character.**

---

## 🎵 SECTION 2: SEVENTH CHORDS

### Adding the Seventh

**Seventh chords = Triad + one more note (the 7th scale degree)**

**Four Common Types:**

**1. Major 7th (maj7)**
- **Formula:** 1 - 3 - 5 - 7 (all from major scale)
- **Sound:** Dreamy, sophisticated, jazz
- **Example:** Cmaj7 = C - E - G - B
- **Chords:** Cmaj7, Gmaj7, Fmaj7

**2. Dominant 7th (7)**
- **Formula:** 1 - 3 - 5 - ♭7 (major triad + flatted 7th)
- **Sound:** Tense, wants resolution, bluesy
- **Example:** C7 = C - E - G - B♭
- **Usage:** Creates tension, resolves to tonic
- **Chords:** G7, D7, A7, E7

**3. Minor 7th (m7)**
- **Formula:** 1 - ♭3 - 5 - ♭7 (minor triad + flatted 7th)
- **Sound:** Mellow, jazzy, smooth
- **Example:** Cm7 = C - E♭ - G - B♭
- **Chords:** Am7, Em7, Dm7

**4. Minor 7♭5 (Half-Diminished)**
- **Formula:** 1 - ♭3 - ♭5 - ♭7 (diminished triad + flatted 7th)
- **Sound:** Very tense, jazzy
- **Example:** Cm7♭5 = C - E♭ - G♭ - B♭
- **Usage:** Jazz, leading to minor chords

---

## 🎵 SECTION 3: HARMONIC FUNCTION

### The Three Functions

**All chords in a key serve one of three functions:**

**1. TONIC Function (Home)**
- **Chords:** I, vi (iii in some contexts)
- **Feel:** Stable, resolved, restful
- **Job:** Establish the key, provide resolution
- **Example in C Major:** C major, A minor

**2. SUBDOMINANT Function (Away From Home)**
- **Chords:** IV, ii
- **Feel:** Moving away, building anticipation
- **Job:** Set up dominant or create contrast
- **Example in C Major:** F major, D minor

**3. DOMINANT Function (Tension, Wants to Resolve)**
- **Chords:** V, vii°
- **Feel:** Tense, unstable, pulling toward tonic
- **Job:** Create tension that resolves to I
- **Example in C Major:** G major, B diminished

---

### Why I-IV-V Works

**The most common progression in Western music:**

**I (Tonic) → IV (Subdominant) → V (Dominant) → I (Tonic)**

**In C Major: C → F → G → C**

**Why it works:**
1. **I = Home** (established)
2. **IV = Movement** (away from home)
3. **V = Tension** (maximum pull back to home)
4. **I = Resolution** (satisfying return)

**This is the foundation of countless songs.**

---

### Chord Progressions in Major Keys

**Common progressions (using Roman numerals):**

**1. I - V - vi - IV** ("Axis of Awesome" progression)
- Used in thousands of pop songs
- **Example:** C - G - Am - F
- **Function:** Tonic → Tension → Contrast → Pre-dominant → repeat

**2. I - IV - V - IV** (Classic rock)
- Simple, powerful, memorable
- **Example:** C - F - G - F
- **Function:** Home → Away → Tension → Away → repeat

**3. I - vi - IV - V** (50s progression)
- Doo-wop, early rock & roll
- **Example:** C - Am - F - G
- **Function:** Home → Relative minor → Pre-dominant → Tension

**4. ii - V - I** (Jazz/Functional)
- Strong resolution, very satisfying
- **Example:** Dm - G - C
- **Function:** Pre-dominant → Dominant → Tonic (strongest motion)

---

## 🎵 SECTION 4: DIATONIC CHORDS IN A KEY

### The Seven Chords of Any Major Key

**Every major key contains seven chords built from its scale.**

**C Major Example:**
```
C Major Scale: C - D - E - F - G - A - B

I: C major (C - E - G)
ii: D minor (D - F - A)
iii: E minor (E - G - B)
IV: F major (F - A - C)
V: G major (G - B - D)
vi: A minor (A - C - E)
vii°: B diminished (B - D - F)
```

**Pattern (same in every major key):**
- I = Major
- ii = minor
- iii = minor
- IV = Major
- V = Major
- vi = minor
- vii° = diminished

**Uppercase Roman numeral = Major chord**  
**Lowercase = minor chord**  
**° = diminished**

---

### Using Diatonic Chords

**Any progression using these chords will "work" in that key.**

**In C Major, these progressions all work:**
- C - F - G (I - IV - V)
- C - Am - F - G (I - vi - IV - V)
- Dm - G - C (ii - V - I)
- Am - F - C - G (vi - IV - I - V)

**Because all chords come from C major scale.**

---

## 🎵 SECTION 5: PRACTICAL APPLICATION

### Creating Your Own Progressions

**Step 1: Choose a key**
- Example: G major

**Step 2: Identify the diatonic chords**
```
I: G major
ii: A minor
iii: B minor
IV: C major
V: D major
vi: E minor
vii°: F# diminished
```

**Step 3: Start with I (establish home)**
- Begin progression with G major

**Step 4: Move using function**
- Options from I:
  - Go to IV or ii (subdominant motion)
  - Go to V (create tension)
  - Go to vi (minor contrast)

**Step 5: Create tension and resolution**
- Use V to create pull back to I
- Progression: G - Em - C - D - G (I - vi - IV - V - I)

**Step 6: Test it!**
- Play the progression
- Does it sound complete?
- Does it feel satisfying?

---

### Analyzing Existing Songs

**Example: "Let It Be" by The Beatles (Key of C)**

**Verse:** C - G - Am - F (I - V - vi - IV)

**Harmonic analysis:**
- C (I) = Home
- G (V) = Tension
- Am (vi) = Minor contrast
- F (IV) = Pre-dominant (sets up return to C)

**Why it works:**
- Functional progression (tonic → dominant → contrast → subdominant)
- Creates motion and interest
- Resolves satisfyingly back to C

**Now you understand WHY it sounds the way it does.**

---

## 🎵 SECTION 6: ADVANCED CONCEPTS (PREVIEW)

### Chord Substitutions

**You can substitute chords with similar functions:**

**1. Relative Minor Substitution**
- vi can substitute for I (both tonic function)
- Example: Instead of C major, use A minor

**2. Secondary Dominants**
- Borrowing V chords from other keys
- Example: In C major, use A7 (V of D minor) before Dm

**3. Modal Interchange**
- Borrowing chords from parallel minor key
- Example: In C major, use F minor (from C minor)

**These are advanced techniques you can explore later.**

---

### Extended Chords (9ths, 11ths, 13ths)

**9th Chord:** Add the 9th scale degree (1-3-5-7-9)
- **Example:** Cmaj9 = C - E - G - B - D
- **Sound:** Lush, sophisticated

**11th Chord:** Add the 11th (1-3-5-7-9-11)
- **Example:** C11 = C - E - G - B♭ - D - F
- **Sound:** Complex, jazzy

**13th Chord:** Add the 13th (1-3-5-7-9-11-13)
- **Example:** C13 = C - E - G - B♭ - D - F - A
- **Sound:** Very full, jazz standard

**These are built the same way—just stacking more scale degrees.**

---

## 🔧 EXERCISES & PRACTICE

### Exercise 1: Build Triads in Every Key

**For each key, build I, IV, V chords:**

**Key of G:**
- I = G major (G - B - D)
- IV = C major (C - E - G)
- V = D major (D - F# - A)

**Key of D:**
- I = D major (D - F# - A)
- IV = G major (G - B - D)
- V = A major (A - C# - E)

**Practice all 12 keys.**

---

### Exercise 2: Functional Progression Practice

**Create progressions using functional motion:**

**Pattern: Tonic → Subdominant → Dominant → Tonic**

**Key of C:**
- I → IV → V → I
- C → F → G → C

**Key of A:**
- I → IV → V → I
- A → D → E → A

**Play these, hear the resolution.**

---

### Exercise 3: Song Analysis

**Take a song you know, analyze the chords:**

**Example: "Wonderwall" - Key of Em**
- Em7 - G - Dsus4 - A7sus4
- Function: i (tonic) - III (modal) - VII (modal) - IV (subdominant)

**Understanding the functions helps you:**
- Remember progressions easier
- Create similar progressions
- Substitute chords creatively
